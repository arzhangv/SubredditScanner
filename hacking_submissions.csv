127,9k3hy,[deleted],"I'm developing a small Python web server and have patched through port 80 of my router to my server. From time to time, script kiddies will request some supposedly vulnerable PHP script to which my server dutifully replied with a 404. That's good, because they then move along.

Of course, none of my links contain the extension .php (or .py for that matter) so now I route every request that contains .php to a special controller function called FuckingScriptKiddies. It returns a redirect to the same script they just requested, so that they hopefully get into a redirect loop, but I'm thinking, does reddit have any better ideas? Some things that crossed my mind --

* Spawning a thread that returns at least 10 MB of \x13\x37 bytes but which doesn't adhere to the HTTP protocol, hopefully crashing their HTTP stack
* Returning a proper 200 with random content, hopefully crashing their script kiddie code
* Requesting a whois on their domain and automatically send an e-mail to the abuse address with a full report of their activities, hopefully causing their ISP (and their parents :-p ) to get pissed
* Redirecting to a random .php path on my server so that there's no redirect loop to detect

I haven't really been able to see yet if their scripts respect the 301 response code, which would be essential for my current handler.",hacking,1252851822,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/9k3hy/ask_rhacking_ideas_for_screwing_script_kiddies/,https://www.reddit.com//r/hacking/comments/9k3hy/ask_rhacking_ideas_for_screwing_script_kiddies/.com

* There are some UDP ports open but connections to these will stay open but not respond in any way

250,c5ys7,ant92083,"So this morning I was researching a url that keeps spamming our users with WoW phishing schemes.  I did a Nmap of the machine and found the RDP port was open.  Testing the admin's intelligence I just created a RDP session with ""Administrator"" and no password.  At first I was going to 4chan the site and make a mockery of them but I did a little digging and found a wealth of information from a title company here in the United States.  Asap I called the FBI.  They routed me to a few different divisions then the IC3 complaint form.  Which I find to be useless in regards to matters of security.  I called the company that was on some of the PDF documents that were floating around on the system (about 2000 of them) and talked to their vice-president.  They are going to have someone from their IT systems call me.  It was pretty scary I found visa's, people's tax forms as well as photocopies of checks and other financial information.

A.) Did I do the right thing contacting the FBI first?
B.) Am I liable for anything?  I am not using the information maliciously, all I did was change their admin password and then handed that to the FBI?

For obvious reason i won't state any information about the server (ip or any other identifiable information) or the company.",hacking,1274285321,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/c5ys7/submitted_a_vulnerable_server_with_financial/,https://www.reddit.com//r/hacking/comments/c5ys7/submitted_a_vulnerable_server_with_financial/.com

267,crd4f,kuhsay,"My friend bought tickets to an event from someone on Craigslist last week.  He sent her $40 cash in the mail, and I told him that he was an idiot and should never send cash in the mail.  He should have sent a money order, or at the very least, a cheque.  He told me I'd be stupid for sending someone I didn't know my bank account and routing numbers (which are on the bottom of a cheque), and that he'd rather lose $40 than share that information.

So my question is: Is there anything a scammer can actually do with that information that you aren't protected under federal law for?  I'm sure they could order cheques online from shady banking websites and then make purchases using said cheques, but wouldn't your liability from that be limited like it is with credit cards?",hacking,1279574510,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/crd4f/how_bad_is_it_if_someone_knows_your_bank_acct/,https://www.reddit.com//r/hacking/comments/crd4f/how_bad_is_it_if_someone_knows_your_bank_acct/.com

I've found [Damn Vulnerable Web App](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/) and [Damn Vulnerable Linux](http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/), but what else is there? 

I'm sure there are Windows versions that were remote exploitable when they came out, even without the user having to surf to a hostile web page, but I can't seem to find a list showing what versions and what services. I'm sure info on the individual holes are available on googling, but I'm hoping someone might have walked down this road before me, and maybe even know a virtual appliance repository for this purpose. 

(OpenBSD 3.1 and 4.0 are supposed to be remote exploitable, btw, I'm looking into those.)

2. Search for

We would call one, and QUICKLY as the phone was ringing, click hangup for the other line, and dial the other one, then click again to join all three calls. Both would answer, we would stay quiet and listen to all of the entertaining awesomeness. It never got old. This was truly the glory days of prank calling. New call features, but no caller ID. Sigh!

He's got the audio from the bug sent to his hotmail account, and any comment anyone makes in her office - regardless of if she's there - is new proof that she's stepping out on him.

The professor prides himself on being very difficult so I was hoping maybe some redditors could help me and my group out.

I'm not sure the best way to share the project files and assignment so maybe someone could suggest the best way to share source code to me? (Uncompiled C) maybe just google docs?",hacking,1300822057,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/g9536/group_buffer_overflow_project_for_school_need/,https://www.reddit.com//r/hacking/comments/g9536/group_buffer_overflow_project_for_school_need/.com

419,ga9er,kittehcat,"So, my boyfriend keeps multiple complex passwords for all of his security needs. He's the last person I would think would get hacked. 

Well tonight he did, and the hacker got a hold of some possibly compromising information, as well as his gmail, facebook, and steam accounts. He sent the info to a few of my boyfriend's contacts as well as threatened to on facebook (and might have over FBchat, we don't know.) 

His Gmail seems reclaimed and his facebook is now locked but we want to do something more.

ISPs are useless right now, facebook is DEFINITELY useless, and we want to track these jerks down. 

Their IP is 71.174.7.99 and I'm pretty new to this hacking thing but I was wondering if there was anything you could do to help me or any advice you could give to us to battle the possible repercussions of this. 

Thanks,
