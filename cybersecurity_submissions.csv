11,gpwjs,[deleted],"Was doing some digging to see if the Xbox360 has any artifacts from DVD playback (e.g. lnk files, volume names, etc). It seems one should be able to just hook up the FATX HDD to W7 and assign a drive letter (write blocking, etc). Sadly, neither I nor work has an Xbox360 to dig around on to see what sort of data is left behind.

25,i3kdm,[deleted],"I am currently working on a android forensic software. You can find it @ [1] https://code.google.com/p/aft/ I need your help to finish it as I don't own an android phone and do most of my work on the virtual machine.

As of now the program extracts databases and photos from the phone and prepares a report on browser history and account information. The end product will produce reports on call logs, SMS sent/recieved, contacts and saved passwords. Will be working on extracting information from other applications on the next version of the code.  

Have written a module to extract EXIF information from the photos. Can anyone tell what are information which need to be extracted from the forensic point of view. I know that the latitude and longitude information are important, what else information need to be displayed.

Also please suggest any features which can be included or bugs which you find. Contact me if you want to help out with coding or testing.

PS: This is more of a learning project as I am new to both python and forensics. So go easy on me :)",computerforensics,1308491311,1,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/i3kdm/need_help_finishing_my_android_forensic_toolkit/

27,i5hbp,Unbelievr,"Hi, computerforensics.

I have managed to restore a partition with Mac OS X and am trying to get information out of the ""login.keychain"" and ""system.keychain"". I am aware that the usernames are plaintext and can be read with any editor, but I have problems finding a tool that can decrypt the password(s). As far as I have been able to research, there are no common tools to do this that will run on Windows/Linux.

I do always know the system passwords and, for the routine, I could probably find another Mac, boot it up and run the built-in tools for ""unlocking"". But since the encryption scheme and all is known (Apple even released the source), I figured there *have* to be some kind of tool out there (commercial or not) that can do this job. Anyone have any experience with this?",computerforensics,1308682355,10,NA,http://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/i5hbp/tools_for_reading_recovered_mac_os_x_keychains_in/

I don't have access to, or money to buy FTK or EnCase.  I have the original hard drive, and have made a raw image of the drive.

I have a client who had a DB over written with a blank DB.  Not exactly how we got to this point since there is no installation media on the server.  That being said, a friend suggested I review the logs and temp folder to see if anything is left of the original DB, or a trail in the logs.

I have reviewed the event viewer logs, but they are a dead end (they are only a few days old).  Is there a different type of log I can be viewing to try and find out at the very least how installation media was conjured out of the ether.
