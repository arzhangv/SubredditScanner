I know that cuckoo can support SSdeep searching (because I am setting one up), but I'm not 100% malwr can.\n\nIn this order, I normally find that the destination IP's and the network protocols are the best way to give me the basic idea of where it is headed. A quick run through these IP's will yield an approximate result such as a family. \n\nAs for specific identifiers, that changes based on the malware itself, and sometimes one sample can act like another sample, or you can just be missing something. For variants, everything from just looking through strings to communications behavior can yield a clue. I end up googling many strings I find, just on the off chance that something will come up, as well as looking at things like metadata (file dates, mostly) and guesswork in that similar vein.
