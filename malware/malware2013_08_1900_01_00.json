He does an analysis like that: http://www.0xebfe.net/blog/2013/03/30/fooled-by-andromeda/    \n\nWhat malware observer does when he can't explain what happens? He does an \"analysis\" like that: http://joe4security.blogspot.com/2013/08/anti-vm-gone-wrong.html    \n\nMalware observers from **Joe Security LLC** did blog post with quite wrong statements:\n\n1. Malware works only in VM. That's wrong statement.\n\n2. Malware does not work on real machine. That's wrong statement too.\n\n\nNow let's check what really happened with that sample.\nThey tried to run in Andromeda sample in VM after that Andromeda detected some of security applications and executed fake payload. Fake payload that opens 8000 port.\nFor some reason they have not found malicious activity on real machine - may be some security app was running. \nAfter that they made false conclusion that sample works only in VM. **But this is wrong statement.**   \n   \n\nIf you don't trust me, you can check it yourself I have uploaded sample with MD5: CC9FAB2465A279B9424DA3A09DF7C8D5 here: http://www.sendspace.com/file/a0hhum    \n\nRun it on clean machine with no security tools running and check after that %ALLUSERSPROFILE%.\nOr to bypass all security checks just change label of C:\\ drive to \"CKF81X\".    \n\n\n**See how easily malware observers can be fooled**    \n\n\nIf you don't want to be a mock of whole industry by making such blog post use IDA PRO - the only right tool for malware analysis.        \n\n\nONLY REVERSING - ONLY HARDCORE!
