I wrote malware for fun (not for profit) that performed the unlinking from PEB step, but I don't think it meets your notability requirements, seeing as it has never left my VMs.\n\nI'm not even sure hiding your DLL is fruitful anyway.\n\n&gt; Can you take over Windows' DLL loader responsibility without being in kernel mode?\n\nYou can map your DLL into another process' space without kernel-mode access. In fact, a lot of the DLL loading code is implemented in userspace in ntdll. If you think you're up to the task, you could step through it with a debugger and watch it work.\n\n&gt; You are right - but wouldn't the result be the same, having a process where a DLL isn't found in _PEB_LDR_DATA, but still in the VAD?\n\nThe result may in fact be the same, but, when your DLL is loaded the normal way, there is a brief moment where other threads can actually see that there is a new library loaded. In addition, hooks on LoadLibrary (and others) in the remote process would be able to detect the loading in progress. Plus, this way, you know for a fact that there is no accounting system that will be aware of your DLL, regardless as to what may change in win32 as time goes on.\n\nI know that there are some modern malwares out there that start trusted system EXEs that don't look suspicious (like svchost.exe and such) in a suspended state, and then rewrite their memory space to fit some other executable in them by remapping pages and such.
