Lots of malware have some basic or botched crypto (stupid xor tricks) they might use to communicate to C2s. some basics would help.\n\nIt really depends on the platform. If you're into windows, learn x86/64 ASM and the windows api calls, and the PE file format. If you're into ios, learn mach-o and arm assembly  (thumb, thumb2, arm). If you're into android, learn smali and or how to convert dex to jar and decompile the jar, and learn java, and how to make apps. Arm and ELF helps there too for native SOs. If you're into linux malware, you'll find a lot with PHP control panels and landing pages. \n\nLinux malware seems to be primarily focused on hosting landing pages that infect users on windows, so php javascript apache web injects and all the points I mentioned for windows would help you learn about it in depth. Might be best to start with windows in that case, since linux malware seems to me to be most involved in infecting windows through browser exploits.\n\nIt's really hard to get in depth without specializing on one aspect, so it depends on what you want to breakdown. I'd pick windows or mobile and keep in mind windows is probably the most predominant, but it might not be as interesting for you.\n\nI'm not particularly interested in windows development (I'm mostly a developer) so I haven't got into all the obscure windows api calls that malware might use, like running stuff in the background and starting hidden threads that you can't see as a process... that stuff can be pretty involved.\n\nFYI that's all just for static analysis. Dynamic analysis is a whole 'nother aspect that involves sandboxing and network traffic analysis. If you're into android RE, check out Droidbox and the vm that has all the stuff set up. I'll forget what it's called but if I remember I'll edit this comment.
