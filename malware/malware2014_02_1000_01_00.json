Yes, many infection methods do involve user interaction; however do not downplay the role of infected .pdfs sent in email or infected web pages. \n\nSecond, very few companies include a \"virus scan\" when you download a file from them; if they do the antivirus is generally crap. Even if they do there is no way of really knowing that the antivirus product itself isn't malicious. \n\nThere is really no reason to use a \"antivirus killer application\" - it's pretty easy to avoid &amp; disable antivirus programatically. Disabling antivirus methods is usually included in as part of the malicious executable, not as a stand-alone. Look at the code for Zeus or any of the other botnets that have been released. Whether the antivirus is running or not has very little bearing on whether the malicious executable is seen or not; most of the time the definitions the antivirus uses simply don't detect the attack (which is helped by the fact that most antivirus comapnies use the same source for all of their definitions).\n\nNo to Java. Java is a cesspool of vulnerabilities. Complicating this is the connection between Java, Adobe Reader, &amp; Adobe Flash (okay, so Microsoft Office might be included in this as well). Adobe Reader &amp; Flash instructions to be passed to the Java Virtual Machine. Since Reader &amp; Flash are 2 of the most common pieces of software on the large majority of machines (no matter whether it's Windows, Mac, or Linux) there is a huge attack surface to use. By passing instructions to Java it allows instructions in those files to be executed on the target machine. If one breaks through the Java \"sandbox\" the executable now can be run against the whole OS.\n\nBinders allow for additional executables to be added to prebuilt programs, but they aren't necessary. You can avoid using a binder simply by writing the virus from scratch (which is the way that many of the \"better\" or more interesting/infectious malicious applications are written).\n\nA crypter is used to encode data or executables to avoid file heuristics. Encoded data must be run through the crypter to be unencrypted so that the OS can execute the commands. They don't install the virus or anything else - in fact the virus loader usually installs the crypter. They don't remove other crypters (if that happens at all it's usually a function of the virus itself). Whether a program shows up in the Task Manager, list of Services, or in MSCONFIG is a function of how the malicious application is programmed.\n\nIf you want to avoid or clean infections look for a good antivirus/antimalware program. Personnaly I like Kaspersky &amp; F-Secure (paid) as they both have pretty decent malware labs. Avira seems to work pretty decently for a \"free\" antivirus. You might also look at MalwareBytes Anti Malware as well - they have a huge following &amp; are pretty decent at detecting infections, especially when paired with a good antivirus solution.", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "downs": 0, "archived": true, "removal_reason": null, "edited": false, "author": "MushinNoMushin", "subreddit": "Malware", "controversiality": 0, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": null, "link_id": "t3_1xhq7m", "id": "cfbn0ov", "retrieved_utc": 1432333439, "updated_utc": 1668790928, "body_sha1": "54648f0c17e5c8eec5670809d4e539f35e2b5ebf", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-02-10 12:41:37"}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "body": "Thank you for your response, and ill try to improvise further articles in correct format.", "created_utc": 1392032106, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "downs": 0, "archived": true, "removal_reason": null, "edited": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "elvis4u", "controversiality": 0, "gilded": 0, "score_hidden": false, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 27047878712, "link_id": "t3_1xhq7m", "id": "cfbmbgh", "retrieved_utc": 1432333109, "updated_utc": 1668790927, "body_sha1": "2fae1d8ddd9529a36b93890be998c53af4c8354d", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-02-10 11:35:06"}, {"subreddit": "Malware", "author": "Ameas", "edited": false, "archived": true, "downs": 0, "removal_reason": null, "ups": 1, "score": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1392029497, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "body": "I am going to assume English is not your first language, as the title doesn't really fulfill it's promises.\n\nThis is more a description of types of infections, with references to Wikipedia. \n\nI applaud your effort to inform people, but it definitely falls short.\n\n", "id": "cfblws8", "link_id": "t3_1xhq7m", "parent_id": null, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1432332916, "updated_utc": 1668790927, "body_sha1": "f0aa77f91902bf58a1672a140cc6fa61e8fada76", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-02-10 10:51:37"}, {"subreddit": "Malware", "author": "tum0ur", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 2, "author_flair_text": null, "score": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1392025082, "body": "That is so horribly written that if there was anything in there at all interesting nobody will see it.
