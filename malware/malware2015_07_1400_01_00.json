We have to look at what may provide a benefit to the user. It is clear that some job postings request or require certifications. Therefore there is a benefit to the user in having the cert as it a. enables the person to learn something new and practice it. b. Have something that insures he may be considered on the same level as other qualified candidates, or may even be considered higher than another candidate without a relevant cert.\n\n2. Find me a malware analyst that doesn't have an understanding of attacker techniques. The course provides an understanding of information useful prior to jumping into malware analysis.\n\n3. We are using this as an example. There is a benefit to having the qualifications. You don't know who the other candidates are or what qualifications they have. Things such as certs can offset your experience. OP could reverse malware for 10 years and never get a job. But if he is like me, someone is going to look at his resume and see some letters, and be like \"maybe we can use you over here, get you some official hands on experience\"\n\n4. I am aware, this is a quick search to find a few examples. Given enough time I could find 4 job postings for malware analysts that are not government contracts which list relevant certs.\n\nEDIT: So let me explain a bit more. People have been disillusioned by the history of certifications. I get it, i've seen both sides. But that isn't me, I hold a number of certs and I earned them all. I use them to gain knowledge, and to improve my chances of getting a job, they of course help in salary negotiations as well.\n\nI have been learning malware analysis for i'd say 6 months, probably less actual time because it isn't my job, so everything happens on weekends and after work. You can see some of what I have done [here](http://sectestanalysis.blogspot.com). I'm sure it looks quite horrid, disjointed, flawed, ect. Because my learning tools up until now have been a set of youtube videos the author never finished and minimal time in the PMA book. I am currently in the FOR610 course which leads to the GREM certification. I've learned new things in the first day that I haven't learned in the 6 months of watching videos. I saw someone dig through assembly in OllyDbg and could follow along with what was being done. Undoubtedly my previous studies helped, but this all will come together to make me a better analyst. When I do apply for some position with a company, that company can look at the GREM and be somewhat assured that I know what a disassembler is, how one is used, what tools I will be using for analysis, and hopefully some level of competency with them. In IT there must always be a balance of relying on certs vs. experience. I've seen companies burnt by both. But I can tell you that i've met a lot of really knowledgeable guys in the industry and all of them had some kind of qualification behind their experience. And I know that when I posted to /r/netsec about a job, I got one reply, asking me if I had my CISSP. I don't expect to put in a resume for a RE position and for the response to be \"do you have the GREM?\" but I know that with my (hopefully better in the future) blog, the GREM, and security arena experience, there is a possibility that if I put my resume in for a position, against a CS grad, a HS grad who says he knows MA but can't demonstrate it on paper, a guy with a MA blog but no experience, I have a better chance to get an interview that if I didn't have it. And I know that if I were to go to school and get some CS type qualifications, I move up higher, because I will have more than just knowledge, more than just education, more than just experience. And to cap it all off, I have something that the company can use to indicate the quality of their employees. I know my company requires all of our Intrusion Analysts to get the GCIA, and I know they use that info when talking up the company to prospective clients. You can have a staff of people who have been doing \"x\" forever, but it helps to be able to demonstrate in a second that they have a level of competence.", "downs": 0, "edited": true, "retrieved_utc": 1437859507, "updated_utc": 1668796437, "body_sha1": "9b215ba08b0e6a497a77c614bfd586d19f8b74e5", "edited_on": 1436926540, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-07-15 00:59:11"}, {"parent_id": 27880902788, "author": "compdog", "ups": 1, "body": "Have you made sure that chrome isn't set to have that as it's homepage, and that it doesn't have a bad extension, plugin, or web app?", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "created_utc": 1436921029, "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "id": "ct3m3gn", "controversiality": 0, "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "archived": false, "link_id": "t3_3daqyy", "retrieved_utc": 1437859230, "updated_utc": 1668796437, "body_sha1": "839c4439419a2d405eedc14e4956d3c68e66aeb2", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-07-15 00:43:49"}, {"score_hidden": false, "created_utc": 1436918386, "parent_id": 27880831705, "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body": "I'm sorry, will do.
