Thank you guys for the incredible answers! Aww no fancy workstation eh? :c Earlier i was looking for some images and i wound of finding some of kasperskys workstations (unsure of which HQ) and they looked pretty cool- dual monitor and such- but it seems laptops are more common than that. that isnt something i would have expected! thank you again for clearing that up! Another question, in all the talks i hear about the speaker talking about working with a client or a person, then going to another client or person.
