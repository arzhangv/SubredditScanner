{"data": [{"controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "edited": true, "parent_id": null, "body": "As others have already pointed out, an Advanced Persistent Threat refers to the actor (i.e. the human(s) behind the attack) rather than to malware. A sure sign that a vendor doesn't know what they are talking about will be if they claim their product \"stops the APT\". It's a meaningless phrase. Consider how you would look at someone if they told you antivirus software will \"defeat China\", \"defeat the United States\", or even \"defeat the Mafia\". You would be right in treating that person as delusional.  \n\nI do understand the confusion though. It's not a very descriptive term, on the face of it, and when the marketing droids got wind of it, the meaning got lost in the noise. But let me take a moment and break it down. From the official definition ([NIST Special Publication 800-39, p. B-1](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-39/SP800-39-final.pdf)):  \n\n**Advanced Persistent Threat**  \nAn adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources which allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception). These objectives typically include establishing and extending footholds within the information technology infrastructure of the targeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding critical aspects of a mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these objectives in the future.  \n*The advanced persistent threat: (i) pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period of time; (ii) adapts to defenders\u2019 efforts to resist it; and (iii) is determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives.*  \n\nFor a less formal breakdown:  \n**Advanced** - This does not immediately refer to the sophistication of an attack or a technique utilized by a malware sample. It refers to the fact that the actor group has Advanced resources at their disposal. Time, technical skills, large(ish) numbers of highly trained personnel, and technical assets/hardware. The use of a zero-day, or even complex malware, does not immediately indicate an APT attack. However, a group of adversaries with the time and technical skill to continually produce or procure zero-days to use in their malware may indicate they're an APT adversary.  \n\nAnother way to spot (not easily) an APT actor is the use of multiple attack vectors. This is not just \"they sent two spearphishing waves\" but more along the lines of \"can they attack the target in cyberspace and elsewhere simultaneously?\" Think different [battlespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlespace) (air, sea, cyber, land, etc.).  \n\n**Persistent** - This is two-fold. It primarily refers to adversaries who can sink a great deal of time and effort into accomplishing their mission. Think *years or decades*. A single attack isn't the end goal. It's one battle in the campaign. The other, less meaningful use for this is that the adversary wants to get on your network and persist as long as they can, undetected. Generally only nation-state adversaries have this kind of time, which is why APT is usually synonymous with a nation-state attacker. It doesn't have to be though.  \n\n**Threat** - The simplest of the three. It just means actor in this case, but gets confused by people talking about the tools the actors used and calling them threats as well. It's partly why the terms \"threat\" and \"threat actor\" have come about, because of the confusion lumping them all together as threats.  \n\nSo, for example, is Stuxnet an APT? No.  Stuxnet is likely a tool developed by an APT actor for accomplishing their mission. But actors will use whatever malware will do the job, especially if it disguises them as basic cybercriminal activity. Don't confuse the malware with the actual threat, the people. I hope that helps.  \n\nEdit: Another [writeup](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-is-apt-and-what-does-it-want.html) from Richard Bejtlich.", "subreddit": "Malware", "id": "cz7dy4y", "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453434450, "link_id": "t3_41wpz2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "author": "romandas", "score": 3, "ups": 3, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1454651169, "updated_utc": 1668779285, "body_sha1": "e4718444d9cd47131d7c35b0476a62d7cbab928c", "edited_on": 1453437472, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-01-22 03:47:30"}, {"author": "ajeoae", "score": 2, "ups": 2, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453431498, "link_id": "t3_421wan", "parent_id": 28249870136, "edited": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "id": "cz7c9px", "body": "Autoruns as well from the Sysinternals suite.
