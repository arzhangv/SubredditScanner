(ASM) Assembly? C? C++? I think one of the books below even teaches by using Python? The most important is probably Assembly right? But when do C or C++ come into play? Which should I start learning now?\n\nI would recommend you start learning C first, then learning C++ specific things ( classes, memory management like new, etc.).  Then learning Assembly and then Python afterwards.\n\nThe reason I prefer this order and which I tell other people is because teaching a beginner x86 assembly is a stupid idea, so having a foundation in C makes it really easy to learn assembly.  The only C/C++ I believe you will do in a reverse engineering analyst job is if you were tasked with dissecting drivers &amp; software and/or decompiling them where you would need to have a C background to understand what is going on.\n\nSince Python is the thing now and is highly used in the books you mentioned earlier, having a C/Assembly background will make Python a piece of cake.  You will use Python for making plugins for IDA or using it to automate your job or do cool things with it ( your own reverse engineering framework, memory editing, binary patching, memory dumping, etc ).\n\nEvery single Malware Analyst, Exploit Engineer or Reverse Engineering job I search for requires these three languages or at bare minimum C &amp; Assembly.\n\nI would recommend you take a look at this:  \n[Malware Analysis Tutorials: a Reverse Engineering Approach](http://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.nl/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html)  \n[Reverse Engineering Malware 101 Material](https://securedorg.github.io/RE101/)   \n[DEFCON 17: Making Fun of Your Malware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeG4KBWB-EY)\n\nAnd for OSX:\nhttps://objective-see.com/blog.html\n\nTwitter feeds I follow:\nhttps://twitter.com/pwnallthethings  \nhttps://twitter.com/InfosecEdu\n\n", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1495275030, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "id": "dhszftq", "link_id": "t3_6c9f9a", "parent_id": null, "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1496678669, "updated_utc": 1668771637, "body_sha1": "fa5dc08a30b8deda50ba7f67753493d52d51e1be", "edited_on": 1495276208, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2017-05-20 10:10:30"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 64, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 11, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1495263660000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1495350060000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1495263660000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1495350060000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.2022774, "api_request_start": 1674105628.378284, "api_request_end": 1674105628.4824777, "api_total_time": 0.10419368743896484}}
