What I'm telling you, I'm speaking from experience. I was writing simple malware at 14. It's something a lot of techy kids do. However, the cost -getting caught- of deploying malware is not worth it unless you have a lot of skill behind you. That means not only programming, but opsec, knowing networking fundamentals (to avoid using something easily reversible like no-ip for Dynamic DNS), understanding how to move money properly (a lot more than just knowing the basics of BitCoin), and getting in contact with EK hosts so that you can get a wider *audience*. Don't trust blackhats; most are unskilled and the best forums are hard to find or are Russian. There is so much to learn; don't get hasty and get caught.\n\n\nI told you to reverse malware so that you can learn from the masters. Why would they give up their secrets willingly in a tutorial? There is an opportunity cost involved in order to even have the ability to understand how APTs and other highly effective malware work. You need to understand at least x86 for this. If you can understand how they do what they do, from the source, then you won't need Trend Micro or Symantec to do the heavy lifting (and censor the parts needed for budding malware developers). Look at Trend Micro's article for some of the earlier ransomware like Reveton; do they talk about how they did the lock screen? There are a lot of technical problems to be solved that won't be discovered in an analysis targeted at blue teamers. \n\n\nUnderstanding C is like learning a single letter in the alphabet; you need it, but it's not the only thing that's needed in order to be fluent.
