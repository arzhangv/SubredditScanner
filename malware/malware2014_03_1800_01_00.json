Enjoy!\n\nIf you want to come close to securing your user networks you need to have an aggressive and layered approach to prevention, detection, and cleanup.\n\nPrevention with aggressive egress/ingress filtering:\n\n* Lock down your outbound ports to 80/443 at the firewall! Everything else is granted as needed. Also, do protocol inspection on 80 and 443 (don't allow ssh and telnet to sneak through on port 80)\n* You should have a web proxy that has at least two good category subscriptions that update QUICKLY. Block anything related to malware, malicious sources, etc. Block anything that is uncategorized, too.\n* Products that \"sandbox\" executables at the egress/ingress (fireeye is a good one, there are many others) are pretty great. If you can tie this in with email attachments... Yay!\n* standard blurb about email spam, phishing, and AV filtering. It's amazing how many enterprise deployments screw up perfectly good solutions that were fine out of the box, but someone went and messed with it.\n* IDS, IPS, and WAF. Do it!\n* AV isn't a 100% solution, but it's not completely useless. It catches the easy crap so we don't have to pay talented analysts and engineers to go catch the easy crap. Keep AV around, just don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n* and so on\n\nQuick detection:\n\n* Actually look at your logs. Remember all that time you spent setting up centralized logging and SIEM so you could be &lt;favorite regulatory thing&gt; compliant? Well, it's time to actually monitor your tools. Everything from IDS to web proxy logs should be in here. It's massively useful, so put it to use. In my opinion, this is the #1 way we can identify active malware and compromise in a network.\n* Act quickly on weird stuff! I know there are a lot of false positives, but a good analyst with some basic knowledge of what normal looks like can make a determination on whether something is weird and needs to be looked at. Get used to having your security team spend a lot of time acting on alerts and continually tuning them to generate less and less false positives.\n* Auto-forensics! Mandiant MIR, Google Rapid Reponse... there are a number of tools that will let you quickly repeat an analysis on multiple machines. Put this stuff to use! 50 people received a phishing email? Figure out what happens when the user clicks the evil link, then auto analyze your findings on those 50 machines to see which users clicked the link. This is also a great way to find lateral movement through your network.\n\nClean up:\n\n* Reformat and try again. If you've identified an infected or compromised machine, take your disk image for historical/analysis purposes and just rebuild that thing. Anyone with an account on the box gets a password reset, etc. We spend too much time trying to \"save downtime\" by doing partial clean ups, and we're never 100% sure we cleaned up (or even found...) everything on the compromised host. More than a few times I've seen further data exfil because someone *didn't* clean everything and the attacker never left. Just nuke the damn things and be very careful and aware of what files you back up and recover in the process.\n\nLessons Learned (pro-tier bonus round):\n\n* Feed back results of malware analysis and incident response into your own tools. Lessons learned is the single most overlooked phase of doing anything with anything, especially in the world of malware.\n* Keep putting in new correlations and information into your SIEM. Oh, that phishing email that got through to 50 machines? Maybe 20 people clicked it. Now you should have a list of URI calls, executable drops, and (time sensitive...) evil IP addresses to look for in your SIEM. If you get popped by the same thing twice, your products haven't failed - *your security teams* have failed.\n* Put stuff into more than just your SIEM. Your auto-forensics product, your IDS/IPS, your WAF... do what you can to write your own stuff for all of these. It will strengthen your security deployments and it will make you a better analyst as you stumble through what types of information generate a bazillion false positives and what accurately finds some evil.\n* Send info back to your AV vendor if at all possible. Did your recently updated AV product completely miss a 5 year old zbot variant? Tell them about it! They just might fix it.\n* Improve your internal security processes. Did you guys, just like target, completely overlook a seemingly innocuous IDS alert that actually indicated your systems were wrecked? Don't feel bad, just make sure you learn from the event and do something to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\nThis is pretty long, but it's not completely inclusive. There are tons more you can do that I didn't even scratch the surface of, but this would be a good start. We can really sum this up as \"defense in depth.\" I feel like there are two types of people - the talented, detail oriented, extremely technical people who actually get stuff done... and the lazy, clueless jerks who passed the CISSP 10 years ago and have been collecting a paycheck based on resume keywords ever since. I think a bigger problem than the clueless jerks is that the good ones have such a distaste for the clueless jerks that we've thrown away and dismissed the really good concepts that have turned into buzzwords. We've done a really good job at focusing our talents, but we've forgotten how to take a step back, look at things from that 50 thousand foot managerial view, and tie everything together into a solution that actually provides security.\n\nEducating users doesn't work. There will always be users who are too stubborn or too dense to really \"get it.\" The users who  do get educated will eventually move on and stop working for you company, and you'll have to try to education someone new who might not be able to get it. The answer is a well organized, holistic security program that covers defense in depth. We really have to just get security done in spite of stupid users :P", "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 27098148961, "retrieved_utc": 1432958900, "updated_utc": 1668792020, "body_sha1": "1abe5e4a773146f1efba4cb1e5bccd24937a0bc0", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-03-18 13:08:50"}, {"id": "cg5jdk1", "subreddit": "Malware", "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": 27097071598, "ups": 1, "downs": 0, "body": "Then what is the solution?
