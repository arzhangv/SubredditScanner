Cybercriminals hide behind layers of protection and it's almost impossible to tell if you have an organization or just a group of independent people, cybercriminals don't register LLCs then give themselves names. A cybercrime organization only ever become apparent when they use malware that isn't sold publicly. For example the guys behind reveton malware (we'll refer to them as the guys behind reveton malware, because they chose not to name themselves), are obviously an organization because the reveton malware is not sold or publicly available so everyone using it is likely part of the organization behind it. The same goes for ZeroAccess botnet, the malware isn't sold so the guys running ZeroAccess botnets are obviously an organization. Even then we assume an organization as we don't have any solid proof (it could all be run by 1 guy who works really hard).\n\nNearly all the techniques / malware you listed is publicly sold and used by an incredibly large variety of people, thus not attributed to any specific organizations. This is why you can't find anything on google, because you're chasing fairies.
