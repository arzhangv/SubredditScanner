The point is that if the security program does not prevent your test malware from executing normally, it sure as hell won't prevent it from executing in convoluted ways. So, a proper test would show that, here, normally this is how the malware is supposed to be stopped, but if it is executed that way - see how it runs just fine?\n\nJudging by your reddit posting history, you have worked/you are still working with antivirus companies. This explains why are you trying to undermine my tests which even if are not well documented(in my opinion they are documented well enough), they prove that those programs don't do shit other than deleting popular viruses. \n\n&gt;Then your site is pointless, because it doesn't explain properly anything and people who want a proper explanation and testing will have to run their own tests anyway.\n\nI do not expect you to trust the test. Everyone who is interested in PC security will not fully trust the given test.
