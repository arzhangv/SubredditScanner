Wait for a crack to appear/weakness in design whereby the key can be relocated. Or wait for the C&amp;C servers which hold the keys get hacked/taken down by FBI. \n\nI don't know why you took in a cryptoware case anyway (at a comp repair shop). You are not breaking that encryption, there are hundreds of the worlds best RE guys who are trying to find weaknesses in the malwares design daily and very rarely does it happen, but it does happen.\n\nSo do you wait for the crack to (potentially) appear, and have the ransom for your files go up. Or do you pay it? \n\nI personally say return the customer the laptop &amp; don't charge them, explain that basically, you can't do shit, not cause you're a little computer shop but because the encryption these things use is military grade &amp; there aint nobody cracking it. Tell them to pay up and then back up all your shit (to offline storage) so you're prepared should it happen again.
