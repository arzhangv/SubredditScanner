{"data": [{"body": "As rude as it may sound, I kinda agree with /u/sorcizard's sentiment here. Dropping randomy-named executables into %appdata% is a super standard thing done by a bunch of families of malware. A malware analyst (if that's a job title) should really be very comfortable with tying these back to a specific entry point.\n\nFor some helpful advice:\n\nIf it were me, I'd take an image of the hard drive and rip through it with log2timeline or 4n6time/plaso and work my way backwards from the info you know about those little files and figure out what dropped them. That should give you an idea of what the malware actually is (rather than AV vendors generic tags), and it really doesn't take much time - definitely worth letting this run in the background and taking a few minutes to figure out what it is before you spend hours and hours trying to reverse binaries.
