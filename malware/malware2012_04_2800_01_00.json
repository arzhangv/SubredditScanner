We wrote something very similar that we use internally. \n\nAny chance you've found a way to overcome McAfee from stomping on the original file timestamp when it quarantines a file?  The only option that seems like it might work would be to enable file auditing in Windows, but that doesn't seem like a great fix. We've asked McAfee support for an answer to the issue as well, but we were kindly told it couldn't be done. \n\n", "archived": true, "ups": 2, "edited": false, "author": "carlhester", "id": "c4hqykg", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_sx600", "created_utc": 1335649523, "retrieved_utc": 1428816271, "updated_utc": 1668801544, "body_sha1": "c874e4c1b30414a155acc13c5a6e293bda98321a", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-04-28 21:45:23"}, {"author_flair_text": null, "archived": true, "id": "c4hlzs7", "body": "Thanks for the info!", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1335616408, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "score": 2, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "downs": 0, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "mr_daydream", "link_id": "t3_stp8x", "ups": 2, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": 26392793311, "retrieved_utc": 1428813874, "updated_utc": 1668801540, "body_sha1": "0f6958f59943e01b9a8a0bcfe5c327dffc98b47a", "utc_datetime_str": "2012-04-28 12:33:28"}, {"score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "link_id": "t3_stp8x", "parent_id": null, "author": "goretsky", "downs": 0, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1335603417, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "score": 2, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "id": "c4hl5nj", "body": "Hello,\n\nRetrovirus is a term which has been recycled several times.  The last time I heard it used, it was to define a computer virus which attacked... other computer viruses.  \n\nIn the case of the definition you are using, the first example I can think of would be the \"Dark Avenger\" (McAfee Associates' name for it) 1,800 byte long \"fast\" file infector from around 1990 or so.  It was called a \"fast\" file infector because it spread on file open and directory operations, not just when other files were executed.  Scan a diskette while the virus was in memory and, Voila!, all the files on it would get infected as they were accessed.  \n\nThis was one of the main reasons it became *de rigueur* to scan for viruses in memory before checking for them on disk.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n", "author_flair_text": null, "archived": true, "retrieved_utc": 1428813470, "updated_utc": 1668801539, "body_sha1": "b63a95cfafa2fac629bc1a1a66e586e949726f59", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-04-28 08:56:57"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 106, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 4, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1335596460000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1335682860000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1335596460000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1335682860000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1674057444.3751245, "api_request_start": 1674101184.1797237, "api_request_end": 1674101184.3154466, "api_total_time": 0.13572287559509277}}
