Atm the op I run is weekly where I test that we have sufficient detection for loader, payload, c&amp;c and exfil (each stage or at least on prior to completing exfil). We have a defined exfil payload size and it's in the hundreds of MB, and part of the op charter requires that it's performed in a way where it's possible to detect. \n\nOf course for IR to see the same thing week in and out we need to change our TTPs sufficiently as IR builds better detection. For me it's usually building a new macro generator, finding a new sandbox bypass, updating our payload's packer or modifying request/response profiles. And unfortunately there are some restrictions on how quickly I'm allowed to make massive changes so I don't destroy IR's metrics every week. In some ways this periodic op is a long-running training session for IR team members.\n\nRegardless, that project looks awesome.
