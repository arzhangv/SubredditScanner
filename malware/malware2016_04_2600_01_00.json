However, I think they are a little out of your league. Malware analysis is a very specialized skill that requires years of training to comprehend the most basic of today's malware.\n\nMalware analysis on the individual sample level (what you learned the basics of in PMA) is pretty much solved. Very few samples of malware will stand against dedicated, individual attention by a team of analysts. The problems we face today are about processing the millions of samples that are disseminated every day. Many of these are duplicates or slight modifications, detecting which malware samples are similar is a big thing. So is the automated analysis of malware. These are both incredibly complex topics that use some graduate level techniques, such as machine learning and symbolic execution.\n\nHonestly, there probably isn't an unsolved problem that you could reasonably solve. There are a lot of companies, universities, and governments throwing millions of dollars at malware analysis. I would suggest either surveying existing research, or finding a different segment of computer science to write your paper on.\n\nOr you could just do what everyone else at ISEF does (atleast when I competed years ago) and make up some BS solution to a big problem that won't ever work.", "ups": 4, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1463715880, "updated_utc": 1668782789, "body_sha1": "429f94a32b839225829cc8b369b0d09e289012e2", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-04-27 01:40:46"}, {"parent_id": 28450236440, "score": 5, "ups": 5, "body": "Obfuscation, building a program that can pick up standard methods of obfuscation and undoes it could be a good idea (although alot of programs already do this).

You want a suggestion for a program that would address a need in the malware reversing community. You then have to research the problem, design a solution, and develop it for a panel of PhDs? \n\nAll of this in a week and a half?\n\nReverses script frequently to deal with a particular sample or packer that is getting in our way. Any of us has a toolkit of Python, perl, name your scripting language that addresses samples we ran into in the past and helps us defeat now. You could find a sample or family of malware, reverse it, design a script to automate some step of that reversing, and submit that for the fair. Can you do it in a week and a half? What do you think?\n\nI don't want to come off as discouraging. We need more young people interested in what we do but reversing is one of the hardest most technical components of cyber security. You have to know everything from OS internals to code logic in everything from c++ to any scripting language you can name. And don't get me started on the warped logic that is assembly. There are billions of more achievable projects you could try, reversing is a mountain you aren't even aware of yet.
