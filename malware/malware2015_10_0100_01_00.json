That's 100% up to the AV industry. Sharing a sample that has a hit with the other vendors is meant to better protect users by ensuring the other vendors are notified but it'd be up to them to create sigs, not VT.\n\nSecond, to remedy false positives you must go to the source, the company who created the signature, not VT. Somewhere the vendor should have false positive disputes and you can make a case that'll get reviewed there. Whether it does anything or not is different, that's up to the vendor. \n\nThird, and lastly, everything the VT team has done, currently does and will do was/is/will always be awesome. Blaming them for being anything other than fucking amazing is nonsense. For example, they allow you to write your own damn yara sigs, no matter how shittily written, and will run them for you (subscription required) over basically all the malware in the world, unrestricted. \n\nBasically, don't shoot the messenger.

So have an upvote.  AG]*\n\nHello,\n\nI suspect you are probably confusing anti-malware engines with anti-malware companies.  Some anti-malware companies license one or more anti-malware engines from other companies, so what you are actually seeing is a false positive from one engine spread across several products that use it.\n\nAt my employer, we use our own engine and apply our own analysis / criteria to determine what we add detection for, our licensees list our product name, and none of them are listed in VirusTotal, anyways, so I wouldn't expect to see the \"cascading\" series of false positives such as you described.\n\nThe other part of your question is flawed for a slightly different reason.  VirusTotal isn't so much for helping end users enumerate the goodness or badness of a file.  It is there to help them make a decision about how to proceed.  A file which is a completely new form of malware may be undetected by all engines.  \n\nAs for whitelisting, there are several initiatives already under way,and there's no real reason for VirusTotal to create its own when it can become a consumer of them from these sources.   One such whitelist is NIST's [National Software Reference Library](http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/).  Another is the [Clean File Metadata eXchange](http://standards.ieee.org/news/2014/icsg_amss.html) (CMX) program started under the IEEE.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n", "id": "cvl6ssa", "retrieved_utc": 1446718667, "updated_utc": 1668780865, "body_sha1": "423b64800a31acad9cce64031fb1cd42e4cae501", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-10-02 01:00:27"}, {"gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "id": "cvl6l00", "body": "What about the Sad face \\ happy face voting, is that purely for other visitors to see, or does VirusTotal use the voting and comments to re-evaluate?", "subreddit": "Malware", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "link_id": "t3_3n5k5f", "author": "j_bombay", "created_utc": 1443747242, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": null, "score": 4, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 4, "retrieved_utc": 1446718565, "updated_utc": 1668780865, "body_sha1": "4f2f42a1ff483792a43d23342816899e44680edf", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-10-02 00:54:02"}, {"id": "cvl5y59", "subreddit": "Malware", "body": "Most AV companies have their own antivirus scanning rig, and use that, not the VirusTotal results, to base detections on, if they do copy.\n\nSo to those AV companies, VT is just a source, and then it's up to their internal resources whether to white list or blacklist.
