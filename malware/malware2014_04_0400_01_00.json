Look at colleges in the Marlyand, DC, San Antonio areas for college. Surround yourself with a community and opportunities and those are by far the best cities to be in. Get internships even now!! Start to look around your city in craiglist, or the classifieds to look for cyber jobs, call them up and ask to go to work with them. Start a project.
