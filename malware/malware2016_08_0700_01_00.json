It's a simple forward. Your ad revenue is paid to you by an ad revenue service, like Google Ads or Yahoo. You should have a contract that they are not using this opportunity to harm your visitors computers. \nThey don't host the advertisment themselves, they have contracts to people around the world who own the adverbs. The link to their server. That's why it's so easy for people to suddenly exchange their adverbs. Even after being approved, they just refer the link to a different set of JS. But, yeah, your ad revenue service has a contract with those, that they don't act malicious. Well, in reality, an ad can have well around 20 or 30 hops. But, those contracts should be followed back and everyone should be able to hold the next one in line reliable. \n\nYet, you see, this is based on the assumption a judge understands how the web works at least as well as I displayed it just right now.
