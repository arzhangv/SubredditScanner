{"data": [{"ups": 2, "body": "I do security and malware reversing/research full time, and I work remotely.  My workstation isn't at all special, I use one (currently 16GB, quad i7) laptop running windows 8, and many many virtual machines locally.  I travel a lot, so I don't even have a permanent desk to take a picture of.  I also have access to loads of hardware and network resources for virtualization of anything else, which I access via various vpns.\n\nOn a typical day, I have to triage multiple feeds of information to decide what to work on.  Which goes something like..\n\n* High impact customer samples, which could be malware samples or exploits.  \n\n* Breaking security things like heartbleed or whatever need to be researched, written up\n\n* Breaking events from other vendors, big public malware writeups, making sure I have samples/coverage/writeups\n\n* Any other important vulnerabilities I want to research\n\n* Any ongoing analysis or writeups, some things I look at everyday to see how they're evolving.\n\n* Finally pull interesting samples out of a queue system to investigate.\n\nOnce you've chosen a task to do, you're basically generating content for any number of teams or systems, whether it be blog posts for cool points or other marketing, signatures for av, ips, or whatever ioc your products use, or making writeups with technical information to resell or pass on to other teams.  Either you or someone else in the chain is going to be using the data to write detections or exploits depending on the type of data.\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1406001604, "link_id": "t3_2bbcan", "edited": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "score_hidden": false, "id": "cj44iyi", "removal_reason": null, "archived": true, "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "tdzmont", "downs": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "parent_id": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "controversiality": 0, "score": 2, "retrieved_utc": 1434833614, "updated_utc": 1668795509, "body_sha1": "e7e03f038fc4ac36608cd015e58b4badeadecfb6", "edited_on": 1406001914, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-07-22 04:00:04"}, {"score": 3, "downs": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "parent_id": null, "author": "Timmy84", "subreddit": "Malware", "archived": true, "removal_reason": null, "score_hidden": false, "id": "cj42tdo", "link_id": "t3_2bbcan", "created_utc": 1405997998, "body": "Security admin here.  Typical day is reading emails for alerts ( soon we are doing away with email alerts and just use a log console with alerts with dashboards.) If there are serious alerts like from IPS ,web filter or anti virus I have the user shut down and have an IT support re-image and we set users password to reset next login and remove device from AD.  \n\nAfter that work on tickets for users that can't login to end point encryption, web filter errors or \"need\" a website unblocked.   Help desk sometimes just guesses who the ticket should goto so you have some for like Browser crashing or random errors that really don't concern security but we get blamed for it. \n\nThe toys are fun but the updating and patching can be a pain especially if the update breaks something for a lot of users.  Lots of checking of firewall rule checking/modifying for users that can't access certain drives or sites.  \n\nIf you have great support for the tools it's great but when you get bad support it's no fun and better to just start looking for a replacement vendor that hopefully has a better tool and support, rather than trying to get better support from a vendor.   \n\nGoing into this field I didn't realize how much there is to learn!  Kinda just have to be jack of all trades and master of none other wise you will get burnt out.   My team is kinda split where some will know one tool A-Z and hardly know anything about another.  \n\nTry not to use one vendor for multiple tools incase you have to switch vendors or supports starts going down hill.   Plus you will be more secure using different vendors.  \n\nDon't have a picture of my cube but just it's just a laptop with 2 screens nothing fancy.  Wish we had like a huge monitor with a dashboard of alerts for tools CPU usage and any attack alerts.
