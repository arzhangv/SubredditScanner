But I'm the admin!\".\n\nWe are not talking about killing/ending processes via task manager. All SSTS kill tests are sneaky ways of killing it. Kill5 is the hardest most sophisticated tests. I ignored previous kills because most security software handles them well. \n\n&gt;You also have something about keyloggers (like, nobody being able to stop them or whatever). Try the Zemana AntiLogger - it is supposed to be specialized for exactly this purpose.\n\nZemana doesn't even work with Windows 10 (neither 8.1). It runs, but it fails even it's own test tool.\n\nI have tested SpyShelter though - just updated the website.\n\n&gt;One set seems to be executing something as a scheduled task?\n\nYou can read more about schedtest on Matousec's website. Those tests do exactly what they promise and you can spot the actions performed by schedtest in command line on the video. I do not show every detail on the videos since it is really hard to record them in one shot and I don't have infinite amount of time to merge/edit them - that's why they are so raw.\n\n&gt;And does the scanner stop the normal attempt to execute the malicious program? \n\nEvery program I test contains HIPS or HIPSalike real time protection. Just because it is not in their signature database it does not justify anything.\n\n&gt;And, in general, try to be a bit more professional. What I see on your site is mostly rants and not much professional, well-documented and explained testing.\n\nPeople who are interested in particular programs will run their own tests. My goal is to provide entry-level information. Whole SSTS package contains like 40+ tests itself.
