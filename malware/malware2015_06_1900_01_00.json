Yes, they do their job correctly and works most of the time. Even a free crypter can bring the detection ratio on Virustotal by half. A paid crypter will be advertised as FUD or fully undetectable (by antiviruses). These crypters will often only have 1 stub shared by dozens of users, people distribute the malware with the stub and it gets detected. The first day it is released, it may have 0 detecting it, but the ratio will rise over several days. Then the creator of the crypter makes a new stub and it's back to being undetected. These crypters are usually sold at a monthly subscription for about $20-$40 a month.\n\nAdvanced crypters for large botnet owners and malware distributors are different. They primarily use manual crypting services with custom coded stubs just for them. Crypting antivirus files is one of the biggest costs of running malware. Once you have a botnet that reaches around 20,000, it is very difficult to go past that number. As with commercially sold crypters, as soon as you update your malware to those 20,000, it's going to be detected in a couple of hours and you'll start losing your bots. Then you have the manual crypts, which usually cost around $50 per crypt with stubs made in languages like C++  and/or ASM. Some are polymorphic crypts and can stay fully undetected for weeks if used with a smaller botnet. \n\nAntiviruses will fail against crypteres if they are using signature based detection. Heuristic analysis is the only efficient way. Heuristic looks at what the file does and the AV can associate those actions with malware. Some crypters advertise as \"Runtime FUD\" which means it takes action to prevent AV's from seeing what their doing, potentially making heuristic analysis useless. \n\nThere's also a lot of malware that can fully disable a wide array of AV's. First commercial malware to feature this was BetaBot released a few years ago. It used a social engineering tactic to elevate itself privileges to disable the malware. A popup would appear when it was installed and it's those boxes that say \"Do you want the following program to make changes to the computer\" and it would have the Command Prompt information under it. They claimed in testing, about 70-80% of users clicked yes, effectively disabling any AV's they have on their computer and installs a user mode rootkit. I have found that MalawareBytes' anti-rootkit can remove BetaBot's rootkit and the malware itself.
