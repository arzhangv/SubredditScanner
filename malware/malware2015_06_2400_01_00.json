Some go a bit further and emulate running the program.  However, complicated programs (such as the entire Node.js core) can be difficult to properly emulate.  Another thing to consider is runtime detectability.  Some AV software might not detect the binary as being malicious, but by watching the actions it takes it's possible to determine if it's doing potentially unwanted things.\n\n&gt; Has this been done before?\n\nAbsolutely.  Scripted languages bundled with interpreter executables is not uncommon.  One such example that gained some negative attention is AutoIt.  The intended usage of AutoIt is to - as the name implies - automate tasks.  However, it has been used to create or dispense malware.  Because of this, even benign AutoIt programs have a tendency to be [falsely flagged by heuristics](https://www.autoitscript.com/wiki/AutoIt_and_Malware).  This is because some AV software ends up flagging the interpreter stub itself, not the actual AutoIt script, as malware.", "edited": false, "retrieved_utc": 1437321975, "updated_utc": 1668795790, "body_sha1": "de40dda918907bab2eebe7194dfaeb097f8b8cf7", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-06-24 21:00:28"}, {"link_id": "t3_3az0fe", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "created_utc": 1435177965, "author_flair_css_class": null, "removal_reason": null, "ups": 1, "score": 1, "id": "cshh0os", "body": "https://malwr.com/analysis/Zjc2OWQyZTE4ZWQ4NGRkZWJmODFmOTM0ZDI2ZDI3M2M/\n\n&gt; Error: Analysis failed\n\nHum ...", "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": 27843619616, "author_flair_text": null, "author": "glinford", "archived": false, "retrieved_utc": 1437321103, "updated_utc": 1668795788, "body_sha1": "2446172465b826714b20774ed5de9edd46222054", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-06-24 20:32:45"}, {"archived": false, "author": "flaccidicus", "author_flair_text": null, "parent_id": null, "controversiality": 0, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "gilded": 0, "body": "OP I like the idea, at least I haven't seen it before!

He eventually sold the project and it was passed around several owners. I don't believe it is in development anymore but it was being sold for only a mere $30 with even a free trial version that lets you hold up to 5 bots.\n\nThese had powerful features, not just basic features like file management. It had functions similar to very popular free Delphi RAT, Darkcomet. You could view webcams, control and view screens, file management, change DNS hosts, key log, DDoS, had persistence features, startup, mutex, all that fancy stuff. \n\nIt was a pretty functional RAT. I saw people with several thousand bots on it, which is very big considering it is a RAT. Darkcomet would shit itself after a few hundred. Older versions of this particular RAT only made .JAR file for Windows. It was developed for several years, support Linux and Mac, and could also produce .EXE files or shellcode in a variety of languages including Python, C++, Delphi, and C#. \n\nIt even had an option on the RAT to display a tray icon on the victims' computer that would say \"You are now connected\" to make it seem more like a legal tool instead of malware. \n\nBotnet owners use bots to sell them to other people, adware, or DDoS. RATs are for more targeted attacks or trolling to mess with people, stalk people, etc. Though I bet a lot of people just load the RAT onto a few hundred of their bots on their botnet just to have fun.

Having a payload detected and removed isn't a \"game over\" for botnet operators if they still have a way to shoehorn a replacement back into your system.  As long as the loader stays present they can continue to replace payloads with undetected versions for as long as they want.\n\n\n&gt; I did see a RAT before made with Java that worked on Windows, Mac and Linux. But it's a RAT and it's not likely to be distributed on a large scale, they would be more targeted infection vectors.\n\nI've seen similar things, but as you mentioned it's probably not distributed on a wide scale.  Most RATs (\"Remote Administration Tools\", but the common user would call them trojans) are used as payloads which depend on some other delivery method to execute.  \n\nThe RAT itself may be cross-platform, but most delivery methods are not.  Some of the more common distribution methods like exploit kits and Java drivebys are becoming more and more difficult.  Browser creators have started severely limiting what sort of content they allow to run.  For example, Chrome now completely disables Java unless specifically enabled.\n\nIn addition, the Java RATs that I've seen appear to be relatively feature immature.  Most only have basic functionality such as file management (upload, execute, download) and remote command execution.  Don't get me wrong, these are still *very* powerful features, but compared to more advanced RATs which are capable of password grabbing, executable infecting, and rootkitting, the Java RATs are way behind.  \nIt's somewhat to be expected though.
