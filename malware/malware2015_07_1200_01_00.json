He should spend his time analyzing code, instead. Nobody and I mean *nobody* looks at certifications when hiring malware analysts in the AV industry. All they are looking at is experience. Sometimes we even hire people with no experience and teach them on-the-job, because analyzing code is hard and few people have the talent to do it. If we get the feeling during the interaction with the applicant that s/he is suitable for the job, we'll hire him/her, certification or not. If we get the opposite feeling, a certification won't help and might even harm because it will create the impression that the candidate is \"faking it\" with paper.\n\nThat aside, my general advice to the OP is to pick a better career. Analyzing malware is a hard, grueling, boring job. You are overworked all the time, because new malware appears at the rate of almost a million daily and there are too few people who can do this. Yes, occasionally you get an interesting piece of code and \"cracking\" it brings intellectual satisfaction - but these cases are rare. In fact, we tend to automate the process as much as possible with various dynamic analysis tools. TL;DR: if you want a career in infosec (or even in AV in particular), there are more pleasant jobs than malware analysis.\n\nP.S. Oh, and to address another of OPs questions. Don't wait for graduation. If you want to work in the AV industry, contact the companies now, especially if there are any near your location. We *love* to work with students who are interested. They are smart and they are cheap. Just tell the AV company that you want to be a malware analyst and would like some advice on how to learn it better. Don't apply directly for a job. They could often help by teaching you the basics and giving you some stuff to analyze. This way you won't make money but you will learn, you'll get experience and you'll establish a relationship with the company.", "author": "bontchev", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_3ctbb9", "parent_id": 27875861950, "id": "ct0l1pl", "score_hidden": false, "edited": true, "score": 5, "retrieved_utc": 1440484299, "updated_utc": 1668796343, "body_sha1": "f15dd94a5253a97488ea6b8cceeadead169ff4b0", "edited_on": 1436701461, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-07-12 11:34:29"}, {"author": "BarkyCarnation", "downs": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1436698837, "body": "&gt; What you need is experience in actually analyzing malware.
