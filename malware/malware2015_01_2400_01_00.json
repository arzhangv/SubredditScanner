I dare say-- many of us.\n\nThe weak link in the crypto-ransomware construct is the delay mechanism between the time you get encrypted and the when the ransom note is published. \nIn earlier versions of Cryptolocker, it published its ransom note immediately. This was easily addressed by users who had backup systems. So the hackers changed the code and in the case of CryptoWall, the delays are up to a month later -- ensuring a costly restoration of older data and the reconstruction of lost transactions.\n\nI am confident that only people who have been attacked by these types of delayed ransomware will see the benefit to this product.", "controversiality": 0, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1424419423, "updated_utc": 1668779551, "body_sha1": "84609e5a06f34106c9bd85a8f109180f882f6ab4", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-24 16:40:03"}, {"distinguished": null, "body": "C:\\Users\\my username\\Appdata\\roaming\\Syosafav\n\nThe executable was located in there.", "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1422086932, "archived": false, "ups": 1, "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author": "VampyreSol", "parent_id": 27571226560, "link_id": "t3_2tgl69", "score": 1, "id": "cnz7470", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1424423087, "updated_utc": 1668779545, "body_sha1": "aff86c632fe4d7fc47f2f393f2738df60632a334", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-24 08:08:52"}, {"created_utc": 1422086734, "author_flair_css_class": null, "body": "Glad you got it taken care of.
