Find the team at the AV company and make friends.  \n\nMost security vendors are going after files like yours.   If you encrypt scripts to exe that is even worse.  The vendors are seeing this as a attach vector, your doing what the bad guys do.  Lots of the time when I deal like a case like yours you are using a flagged tool.   We look at the extraction tools and if used 70% of malware creators they black list the program.\n\n\nYou might need to change a few components, as this is only going to get worse as Behaviour monitoring is looking at this in most new scan engines.  \n\nI used to be Fortinet certified and worked with Security vendors.    \n\nIf clam is not getting back to you reach out to people politely on Twitter.
