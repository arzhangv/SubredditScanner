Personally, I like the idea of P2P bots as they seem to be better for preventing traffic analysis of the bots. IRC is just way too vulnerable to being taken over / destroyed.\n\n I remember a while back someone tried to get me infected with an older IRC bot and I had the source to it and I just updated the binary to it to kill the bots after the actual bot owner logged on. It was amusing to do as well. IRC just leaves too many doors open for someone who's bored and finds out your network and also if you know how to set up an IRC, you know how to bring one down which can lead to someone finding out how to get oper on a server. Finding a person's password is trivial at times. :P", "parent_id": null, "link_id": "t3_zkcn7", "ups": 1, "retrieved_utc": 1430179256, "updated_utc": 1668799830, "body_sha1": "d792c1dc64fc086b856f29437f9ed6d1e206fd01", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-10-18 13:19:49"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 57, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 1, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1350543660000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1350630060000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1350543660000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1350630060000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1674057444.3751245, "api_request_start": 1674101552.493505, "api_request_end": 1674101552.5904346, "api_total_time": 0.09692955017089844}}
