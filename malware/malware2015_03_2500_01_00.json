There are legal, technical implications as well as business considerations that make it the less than ideal choice (besides breaking https) for example if the proxy fails then that user will no longer have internet access, and in turn you are more likely to lose that user, which they'll uninstalll and probably report as virus. If you're doing this at scale (as most of these companies are) it's a huge problem. Whereas if an extension fails the user is more or less goes about business unaware of any problem (since they are usually javascript implementations)  \n\nThe average user downloads and installs this software regardless of what the software implementation is.  \n\nThe decision for the most dominant browser to not allow 3rd party extension installing and raised uncertainty in ad supported extensions, messed with the business model of very large and powerful businesses, if they are to continue that business model(which of course they will) they have to look at other alternate means. A proxy/network driver in this case makes more sense since it bypasses the browser entirely, still gives them the desired result and as an added bonus, turns the tables, making the browser slave to the adware.\n\n\n", "author_flair_text": null, "score_hidden": false, "id": "cpr195u", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1432019120, "updated_utc": 1668792710, "body_sha1": "825ff73b288b0c7dca57772757bd2779f304b4e3", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-03-26 03:44:26"}, {"distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "gilded": 0, "parent_id": 27677485759, "ups": 1, "created_utc": 1427329094, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "removal_reason": null, "body": "The problem is the extent that was required to show an ad dramatically increased.
