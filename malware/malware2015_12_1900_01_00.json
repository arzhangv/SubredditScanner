It's mostly about sharing threat information, and allowing entities to monitor their traffic... which already is going on.

Now they can share the PII in that instance, of that specific entity that is believed to be the bad guy. They can give them information of all the other links the guy visited on facebook, but they have to strip out personal identifying information.

And with cybersec law enforcement, a lot of them don't fuck around when it comes to privacy of individuals who aren't bad guys in my personal experience.\n\nAs for malware researchers, I think the main thing you have to worry about is if you play with malicious infrastructure and do things like login to a vulnerable malicious web shell or something like that. Maybe if your activity looks malicious, the people that are investigating that web shell could send your IP to the government, and you might possibly be thought to be a part of it.\n\nBasically, have proof you're a researcher and not the bad guy. Show what you do, have some notes, maybe even a blog that shows your intent is to study malware, not distribute it. And don't do evil things.\n\nResearchers get a shit load of leeway when it comes to stuff like this.
