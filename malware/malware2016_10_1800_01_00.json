Looking at the pastebin data you provided, here is my guess what happened (this is all without timestamps, so keep that in mind, although if they time stompped it wouldn't matter anyways):\n\n\n1a.) You got popped with the Alureon (a.k.a. TDSS). This is what I would consider a kernel level RAT since it subverts the MBR to avoid analysis and it can then avoid kernel-mode driver signing. They could have done a couple things with this. It was either used to steal data (like banking info) or you were sold off on a botnet to participate in DDoS attacks, or both.\n\n\n1b.) 0access hit you first and then installed Alureon or you got hit separately with both.  However, since Alureon survives by being silent I would bet they came in separate instances. 0access, on the other hand, probably pulled in and installed all the fake AV scareware bullshit and tried to get you to pay for a bogus service. Based on that, I'd guess that those guys might not care as much about data theft, but rather just a bot framework set up to scam people into purchasing fake AV software.\n\n\nHow out of date is your system? These threats are pretty old, and you probably got knocked via drive-by-downloads on malicious sites. Update Windows, I'd recommend getting Avast for a free A/V solution, Malwarebytes can run fine along side of that. I'd recommend you change all of your passwords on any site you have an account on since you were probably keylogged. I'd also do some Googling on manually removing TDSS and kazy (0.acccess) to make sure you are clean, although you can never know for sure.\n\nGood luck @OP", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "id": "d8xzetc", "author": "SundrySix", "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "score": 1, "created_utc": 1476832780, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "link_id": "t3_585gf1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1478708800, "updated_utc": 1668776864, "body_sha1": "9fb3992470c194f70886ef8cee836a945dc7fe3e", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-10-18 23:19:40"}, {"subreddit": "Malware", "link_id": "t3_586nnx", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "created_utc": 1476828159, "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "score": 7, "edited": true, "distinguished": null, "id": "d8xvvyv", "author": "saucy80", "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "body": "We got a very similar sample today, if you step through the macro you'll see it uses power shell to download a binary to the system when the user clicks on one of the images contained in the file.
