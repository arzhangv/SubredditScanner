Possibly look into another AV vendor to use on a flashdrive just as a double check. \n\nMight also sound like you use the same password for multiple accounts? I would change all the passwords to facebook, email, steam, origin etc to be different. Enable two factor auth for as many accounts as possible and use a desktop password manager such as keepass or 1password. Try not to save passwords in your browser if at all possible because most PWS malware will look in default directories for chrome,mozilla,IE, origin, steam, etc. \n\nBut from my research the foodloin[dot]xyz doesnt have any malware associated with it on Virustotal. \n", "id": "cw8i781", "ups": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "score": 1, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 28070562251, "created_utc": 1445487110, "author": "mikesxrs", "link_id": "t3_3ppqo4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": false, "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1447120426, "updated_utc": 1668781530, "body_sha1": "349a8a08b3b357fb8f1d656e027ea1b2b1aea609", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-10-22 04:11:50"}, {"ups": 2, "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "parent_id": 28070530264, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1445485821, "author": "XxNuGxX", "link_id": "t3_3ppqo4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": true, "subreddit": "Malware", "body": "~~I'm not sure, would it be in a log file?~~ Someone got one of my email passwords today and tried to do an Account Recovery on Steam, luckily I had changed my email for Steam a while back. \n\nEdit [Here is a picture of my Quarantined stuff](http://imgur.com/n0JmIeK)\n\nI should check all and delete right lol?\n\nThe email that was compromised had the same password as my Origin account, which I think had a security breach earlier this week as well.
