Ida pro is a great tool, which rapidly become indispensable when you learn how to use it, but it's not a mandatory requirement.\n\nI tend to agree with /u/advanced_reddit_user here. Lots of autoproclamed 'malwares researchers' on twitter (but not only there) post about malwares, without never looking inside the binary. That's why you get so much wrong reports, because the analysis of the direct visual in a VM might often be the result of a non-standart behavior. AV firms are not exempted by this, trendmicro is the perfect example with their shitty blogposts which are often six months late or crippled with bad informations gathered from sanboxes outputs (look at their andromeda posts).\n\nI'm not saying that observing the behavior of a malware is not malware analysis. I'm saying that to do malware analysis, you can't limit yourself to a basic traffic analysis &amp; a cuckoo report ; it must only be a limited part of the work you have to do when analysing a binary.
