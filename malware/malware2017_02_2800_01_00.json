Botnets for hire\n2. Phishing with botnets\n3. Selling stolen data\n\nTo my knowledge, \"botnets for hire\" usually come in two varieties: hiring for DDoS and hiring for access to the infected host.  You're not looking to DDoS, so you probably want the second option.  Do you already have tools written to conduct phishing attacks and harvest credentials?  You could always buy/rent some pre-made tools, but the seller probably won't give you the source code and you'll have to trust that they haven't backdoored it.  You'll also have high rates of bot attrition to deal with.  Maybe your tool starts getting flagged by anti-malware, maybe the botnet owner's other customers removed your access because they don't want to share the bot.\n\nPhishing using botnets is a different beast all together.  Where does the botnet come in?  Do the bots send the emails?  Do they host the landing page for phishing attacks?  Sending emails isn't something you can just do with a random infected host.  If you already have a way to send bulk emails then you don't need bots.  If you don't already have a way to send emails, you'd have to find a way to hijack the email accounts of the infected hosts.  If they use a local email client it's probably easier, but what if they only ever use a web interface?\n\nEven if you do manage to get mass quantities of spam sent out and have a phishing landing page, you'll still need some sort of C&amp;C server to act as a dead drop for the looted credentials.  Setting up and maintaining a C&amp;C server is probably harder than you think.  You could host your own server, but that could be tracked back to you.  You could rent a server, but you'd have to find a host that a) will turn a blind eye to your activities and b) won't run off with copies of your harvested data.  You could use a legitimate, but compromised, server but your entire campaign is ruined you're detected.\n\nAssuming you do manage to start a phishing campaign and successfully harvest a respectable amount of valuable data, you've still got to find a buyer.  If you're new and people won't vouch for you, nobody will buy your data.  If they do, they'll only give you a fraction of the going rate because they're taking a gamble on you and your data.  Another problem is that data loses value over time.  There's nothing stopping your buyer from reselling the data and unlike physical goods, every seller gets to keep their own copy.  The more people who use the data, the more likely the compromised accounts are to become inaccessible.  Maybe the owner noticed their account was breached, maybe a buyer changed the account's password to prevent resale.\n\nSorry if this doesn't answer any of your questions, but hopefully it gives you food for thought.", "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "parent_id": null, "author": "Browsing_From_Work", "link_id": "t3_5wfbqh", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1488319577, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "id": "dec9nky", "retrieved_utc": 1489221003, "updated_utc": 1668777484, "body_sha1": "a92f68305ddbe35870a4045afbac115719694065", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2017-02-28 22:06:17"}, {"stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": false, "id": "dec37mr", "author_flair_text": null, "score": 1, "gilded": 0, "body": "The only thing I can imagine from what I've seen in the wild is pasting what's in your clipboard or copying a malicious link into your clipboard.
