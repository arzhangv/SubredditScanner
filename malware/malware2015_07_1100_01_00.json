The job postings for malware analysts will generally ask for things that are actually relevant, like experience performing malware analysis, reverse engineering binaries, and working with low-level code. GREM is a nice to have, but the only thing that is going to matter (shitty government shops aside) is whether or not your resume demonstrates that you have the skills to perform the work.\n\nIf someone's looking to get into malware analysis, GREM isn't a bad course to take. However, its going to be hard to land a job as an actual malware analyst with no practical experience.\n\nEdit: I see that you work for the federal government.
