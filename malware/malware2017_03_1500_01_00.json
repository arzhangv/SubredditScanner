So it's more about practical applications and a primer on how to approach malware analysis problems. \n\nIf your career goal is to do nothing but reverse files all day and work for an AV company, it's not going to be right for you unless you're currently at zero knowledge or have never done anything but throw a .exe into pestudio. But if you're more interested in incident response and forensics but also love RE, it's a good introduction that can help expose you to more tools and such. A decent resume bullet point too, I suppose.
