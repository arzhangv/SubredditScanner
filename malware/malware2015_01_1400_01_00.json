Of course this requires you to pay for another internet line, but it's worth it if you will be doing anything serious with malware anaylsis. The advantage of having a virtual machine dedicated to notes is 2 fold, 1. risk of infection is limited, and 2. it's portable, you can make clones of your VM images and use them anywhere and create screenshots if anything goes wrong.
