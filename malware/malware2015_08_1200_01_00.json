I can see how loaders might become feature bloated over time.

The line can be fuzzy sometimes. In those cases, some people will still use the malware as a traditional loader, while other customers may use it as the \"final stage\" itself.\n\nThis can also be due to greed on the part of the loader developer/seller, who may want to use it to monetize the bots that the loader runs on. (Though this may be disliked by the customer, and may be considered almost as bad as scamming in some cases, if the loader distributor is discovered to be doing this.
