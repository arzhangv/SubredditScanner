The spambots IP are the same as before, so it is obviously not spam botnet matter. \n\n2. Some same hacked sites are keep on being used, so, apparently the hacking sites supplier is active as usual too.\n\n3. The CNC are new, this could be it. But yet, they can switch the CNC anytime they wanted too.\n\n4. Firstly we saw same old Locky version in 1st comeback. Then..New botnet is pushed w/rockloaders and Bart ransomware were seen recently too. Then, a new type of Locky also spotted too. Suggesting development happened. But doesn't have to be a long inactivity for this.\n\n5. For vacation matter. The payment received by them seems big, but the cut for it looks big too, for hacked sites suppliers, for the main / upper \"distributors\", for the spam botnet and for infrastructure ..even it looks cheap..but the cheapest ones is like average USD 150 to 160 per month to each C2.. the expensive one is like USD 250-300 ...and these are times to 5 per month to each dedicated machines in the current places they rented now. And last one is the cut.. for their members. So they have to keep on making evil money or out of business I suppose.\n\n6. Some of the bullet proof hosters in east EU part were down, until now, this \"could be\" the reason, for this threat and several threats to be inactive. The reason for these services down remains unknown.", "link_id": "t3_4pzbh8", "retrieved_utc": 1469367592, "updated_utc": 1668785113, "body_sha1": "b388e86961fc5c3de41428a3f6d10a3ff94fecf4", "utc_datetime_str": "2016-06-29 04:59:35"}, {"gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_4qb1cz", "body": "I believe several CERTs are receiving the data. In the perfect world, they are contacting the NOC/abuse to push the clean up.

MOstly are coming from place where the CERT is not actively act nor monitoring this threat. For that, we may need to push more the \"abuse\" in each service to cleanup the hacked nodes or close them after certain period of time.\n\nI am very sure also that the ransom criminals are watching which hacked sites that are cleaned up.\n\nMaybe your idea will help, for that purpose, overall links to dump the nodes that I followed (including this) is as per below list:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4qb1cz/locky_ransomware_campaign_june_28th_2016/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4q4gg7/locky_ransomware_campaign_june_27th_2016/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4q4gg7/locky_ransomware_campaign_june_27th_2016/d4r5epq\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4ps9en/locky_ransomware_campaign_june_25th_2015/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4p9uli/locky_ransomware_new_campaign_payload_nodes_and/d4ko425\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/4p9uli/locky_ransomware_new_campaign_payload_nodes_and/\n\nWhat I can do soon is put the nodes in site like Github and flag them with \"cleanup\" or \"not cleanup\", I will do that right away.\n\nNoted that, each lists are only coming from spams, to our smtp honeypots.
