Response was correct and swift in pulling the infected machine.\n\n Problem is I can track exactly what time she got hit and Im convinced it was an email attachment. I have 3 and one states there is an infection in the body now. That day it made it in. I took the 3 emails and checked and there is a weblink to a site. Its in the body and in the .zip\n\nOne of our 'consultants' declared that you cannot get a virus from Outlook newer than 2000. It was also stated that our spam filter and AV should have caught it. Neither did and our consultant is a moron as you could RTF infections in 2007 and 2010 without updates.\n\nI prefer lots of backups and protections in layers.
