They can just sell all the raw data in bulk to small, shady marketing firms. Those firms might be hired by a company to help sell a product. So the marketing guys, if they can get a list of people who've bought the product and see what other sites they visit and focus advertising there. They can learn key details about a customer base to target marketing. Legitimate companies do this all the time, but what makes these guys shady is that they don't care where the data comes from.\n\nOn the blackmail side, say you've infected Joe Blow's box. You know Joe is married, an active participant in the PTA, a deacon at the church, and also browses craigslist to find men for casual sex, or he frequents \"jailbait\" porn sites, or he is addicted to online gambling. You know which facebook profile belongs to him, and there you can see his employer, make contact with his wife, etc. So now you can message Joe and threaten him  Additionally, if you've already infected his machine you could cryptolock his drive and hold his data for ransom.
