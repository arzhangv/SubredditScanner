I'm sure I'll get even more hate for this, but I cannot stand games or gamers. I weaned off of Windows completely (100%) about 3-1/2 years ago and haven't even thought to look back. Not a fan of Apple but I do like OSX very much. Privately, I only use  GNU/Linux, GNU/kBSD and *BSD. None of which would be viable as a real gaming platform (yet?)  even if I were into such a thing.\n\nTo each their own. I don't actually hate gamers, I respect your choices. What I really mean by that is I would hate myself if I was one...to clarify. \n\nOnly responding with all this meaningless off-topic crap because you kind of asked. \n\nedit: formatting fail. \nBack on topic (sort of) it makes a LOT more sense to run Windows inside of Linux but not the other way around for obvious reasons... and I don't just mean security. The only reason I need to this is for malware analysis, I have no other use for it.
