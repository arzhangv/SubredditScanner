Also, until I figured it out (when reading about chapter 8) I missed the information what is it all about this reverse engineering. I'll try to explain (but I'm still not employed so maybe I will be little bit wrong with something).\nFirst of all, you should pick the platform on which you want to analyze. Majority is Windows so I'll write about Windows. Then, what kind of programs? Java (and others interpreted) or classic PE (executable) files? PE files are majority so I will write about them.\nSo, what actually is PE executable? Just a numbers, which signifies: data, code etc. The main interest is code. Those numbers can be represented as assembly instructions, for example byte 0x90 is NOP assembly instruction. When you are reversing PE, you have just a numbers. It means, just a assembly instructions. So, you need to understand assembly instructions, memory etc. If you don't understand assembly (oh, I didn't mention that 32-bit architecture is still more popular, so start with it), go and learn it. It's not so hard, it should be enough to understand memory and learn about 20-30 most popular instructions.\nNow we can go to RE. You will need disassembler or debugger (you will learn about it in that books) which shows assembly instructions, data etc. The main job of RE is understand assembly instructions and Windows API (then it is getting harder - obfuscation but that's not important for now). For this I strongly recommend to you to start reversing your own **very** easy C programs like printf(\"hello world\"). Then add some conditions (if, switch case), loops, to little bit more complex programs (something about 30-40 lines in C). Make sure you truly understand your own C programs when you are reversing them. Then, continue with books and practise reversing those malware samples. Sometimes change to reversing files from crackmes.de (we can say in this case that reversing is basically cracking). You can practise as much as you want on that site.\nI wouldn't recommend spending time on reading or writing blogs about malware, new attacks etc. Those are just interesting activities but definitely not the most beneficial for malware analysis when you just begin. If you want to do hard technical job like malware analysis, you need to do more technical things.\nTldr - learn assembly, start reversing your own programs, read that book, do some crackmes.", "edited": true, "parent_id": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "id": "cs6clbh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1436995374, "updated_utc": 1668795455, "body_sha1": "018cbb546e0cf6a665bbcdc49e3abe93e7041576", "edited_on": 1434306121, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-06-14 18:15:34"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 68, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 2, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1434265260000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1434351660000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1434265260000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1434351660000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.2578893, "api_request_start": 1674103759.5315857, "api_request_end": 1674103759.635796, "api_total_time": 0.10421037673950195}}
