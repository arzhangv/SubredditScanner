The click rate was quite high for our users, considerably higher than most spam. We had almost 55 users click on the messages. Our web filter blocked most of the sites due to poor reputation, but a few got through. Additionally, we had 5 requests to unblock the malicious sites by users thinking their CCs were compromised and trying to investigate. Also, many of these messages were quarantined and then later released by curious users. \n\nI'm interested in how other orgs respond to these sorts of campaigns. We have Postini and an antispam gateway, and our web proxy catches many of these to prevent infection. We're quite good at detecting these and scoping the infections, but we're looking for another layer of protection to help further reduce impact.  \n\nI expect this attack approach to continue and for the emails to become even more crafty. With that in mind, are there any other ideas that have worked in other orgs?\n\nI'm curious - Do any other orgs play whack-a-mole with senders/subjects/servers/header information?
