General rule of thumb is to have a sandboxed environment that is properly segmented so that you are detonating malware in a controlled and observable environment.\n\nTo answer your main question, I think it depends on how much you value your \"main\" computer. In the event that something goes terribly wrong, can you risk losing everything on this computer. If they answer is yes, then go for it. If the answer is no, better have something else available to do this type of work. Additionally, always separate whatever system you are using to conduct research from others. Once again, in the event that something goes terribly wrong can you afford to lose everything on that network. Anonymity plays a role in this well. So consider that too.
