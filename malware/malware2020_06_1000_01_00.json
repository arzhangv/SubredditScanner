However...\n\nThe course is OK. The cert is not hard, all GIAC certifications in my experience can basically be passed by combing over the SANS material and building a solid index. I know people that have never done the labs on some of their courses and they come out with 90+ solely based on a thoroughly created index. These exams aren't performance based and should be taken with a grain of salt. I've seen some people that you would never think have touched a computer nail these certifications and it shows in their job. This leads into my next point.\n\nYou get what you put into it. SANS FOR610 will cover a decent amount of malware analysis techniques, but all the course and certification ultimately culminates into is being able to say \"I'm knowledgeable enough in malware analysis to research further on my own\" in order to really pursue advanced malware analysis. \n\nYour interviewer will see right through you if you're one of these people that steamroll through these GIAC certifications without knowing what's going on, especially when it comes to malware analysis. No one really gives a shit about certifications, they will pass you a binary or a file and see what you can do with it, or you will show up and prove that you know your stuff. If you're one of these people that collects certs for the sake of it, you won't be in for a good time.\n\nThe pretests are \"somewhat similar\" but not \"identical\" to the exam. You will find that they are similar in some ways, but often more different than similar. I have also found that both \"practice exams\" that GIAC tends to give out are too similar to each other. Also the test is 2 hours for 75 questions, there is a lot of time if you know your stuff.\n\nIf you need the course and certification on your resume, great. However, you can get the same knowledge by reviewing the following resources:\n\n\\- Malware Unicorn Labs (Blog/Workshop)\n\n\\- Practical Malware Analysis (Book) (do all the labs too)\n\n\\- OALabs (Youtube) (actually get the samples and work through them)\n\nIf you do those and were then to take the SANS course, there will be so much overlap you will probably be extremely bored, but would definitely nail the test. You might even be able to pass it without the SANS course. $7000 in comparison to the above mentioned resources is an absolute waste of money but if you're just after the knowledge, then follow the above resources.\n\nSANS is a little better about teaching malicious documents, javascript, etc. You'll need to find more resources regarding this if you take a different route. This shouldn't freak you out though. Think of it like this, look at the syllabus of the SANS course. They can only fit so much into each section... there's a single book dedicated to PDFs, Microsoft Office (docx/xls/doc), rtfs, javascript, vbs, vba, etc which in its entirety is at max 200 pages. If you do some basic math and get a rough estimate on how much content for each topic of those is in 200 pages, I'm sure you will find no difficulty in researching other tutorials/websites to teach you those topics elsewhere....\n\nRegardless of your path, you need to invest time and energy into analyzing malware samples on your own. Whether that's SANS or not, it's a starting point, it'll be enough for you to go out on your own to build experience, which is what you will need to demonstrate.\n\nBut by all means, if someone is paying this cert and class, never say no. The benefit is the course is an \"all in one\" package that comes with 2 VMs, videos, labs, and a final \"CTF\" lab to further cement your reflexes with the tools. If you go another route, you just need to make sure you do everything you need in order to make up for the benefits. But I wouldn't even spend $1000, let alone $7000, when I can obtain the knowledge from those other resources.
