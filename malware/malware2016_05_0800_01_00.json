If you care to test that, go to Defcon and tell people you find 0-days all the time, and then tell them you meant 0-day viruses, and let me know what kind of reactions you get.  Based on that standard, I find 0-day's all the time too.  It's just not an accepted use of the term.  I didn't misread, you've been misled by Wikipedia, and I suggest you save yourself some future embarrassment, and not use the term 0-day in this manner.\n\nI disagree with you that payload is a better term to use, because payload is specific to an exploit, and many, if not most, damaging attacks these days don't use exploits to begin with, and some exploits (like privilege escalation) don't even have payloads.  Also, it is documented that attacker use of zero-days is rare.  Once they have used an 0-day, it is burned, and the clock is ticking until it is unusable.  Sophisticated attackers generally follow the rule of using the lowest level of exploit that allows them to accomplish their mission.  Stuxnet was astonishing due to the fact that it not only used 0-days, it used multiple 0-days.\n\nOn the scanners, I'm familiar with both you have linked to, as well as more sophisticated commercial products that do the same type of thing.

Check out those sites themselves.\n\nI'm not too well-versed on the 0-day side of things but I can speculate. I'm guessing any \"0-day detection\" is basically checking for the effects of a 0-day: Buffer Overflow, Directory Traversal, shellcode execution, privilege escalation, etc.. So they'd have to hook basic (probably kernel-level) functions and check the outputs for expected results VS unexpected results. Did the program write more bytes than the hard-coded buffer could hold? Did the program successfully access files it shouldn't have been able to access? I would think that the 0-day detector would have to somehow understand the context of the program's execution down to the function or system-call level.

Zero-days are expensive, and rare, and attackers tend not to use them in other than exceptional circumstances.  Zero-days is a reference to the software author's knowledge of the exploit, and once the software author knows of the vulnerability, the clock starts and we move past day zero.  You also seem to potentially be confused in the distinction between malware and exploits.  Exploits aren't generally something we use \"definition lists\" to stop.  That's not to say it's completely unheard of, but generally exploits are mitigated in other ways.  Also, if it appeared on ANY definition list, meaning it was known to someone, it is not a zero-day.
