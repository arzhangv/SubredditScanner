Some legitimate programs behave in similar ways to malware and that is where false positives come from.\n\n&gt;A botnet could look just like a browser plugin (all it's doing is collecting keystroke information in the browser and sending packets).\n\nDepends where it's sending the data, and whether the user is aware of the fact that keystrokes are being recorded and sent.\n\nTo be honest, one way we do it is to simply look at files with emerging popularity then do deep analysis of the behavior in an emulator.  We look at where data's being sent, what's being done, and whether that was something the user expected to be done.  If not, it's malware.\n\nAnd rather than looking at just the code, although you didn't really mention this, we look at the instructions sent to the machine by the code in conjunction with the code itself.  This allows us to recognize certain behaviors even when the code is obfuscated.\n\ntl;dr -- There's a holistic approach that goes into malware detection.  We pick the stuff that gets the most traffic, analyze it and anything it communicates with, and go from there.  But nobody's perfect, hence FPs.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm an analyst, not a developer.  There's a lot about code I don't know, and I'm not the one manually reviewing samples.
