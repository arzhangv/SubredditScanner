That's the default value of the environment variable \"temp\" on an XP machine. \n\nThink back to 6th grade algebra, introduction to variables in mathematics. It's the exact same principle. Except instead of x = 1, temp = a directory path. The %x% syntax simply tells Windows to swap the letter x for the value of x in the given context. \n\nSo it can be configured on any given machine, and competent developers can use these variables to ensure that their programs will run on the target system without incident, even if C:\\ has been configured as Z:\\ or something. \n\nI'm not sure if you're wrong or not. Temp is a favorite of developers everywhere because you're damn near guaranteed to be able to write to it without admin privileges. It's a favorite of malware authors for this same reason. I personally abide by the philosophy that curiosity should be pursued under nearly any circumstance. \n\nAs for the discouragement, I get that. This is a field requiring an enormous breadth and depth of knowledge, it's easy to get confused, especially at first. But we all had to start somewhere. If you enjoy security, stick with it. We all had to start somewhere, and it really does get easier (and more fun!) over time. \n\nIf you need any specific guidance, feel free to let me know. I'm always glad to be able to help out a nub!
