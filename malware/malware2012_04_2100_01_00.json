{"data": [{"score_hidden": false, "edited": false, "body": "To get into malware analysis, you need to live and breath code. The companies that have reverse engineering teams only hire the best of the best programmers. I don't want to discourage you from this field, but you have to be realistic about it. I'm sure that you most certainly are capable of doing it, but getting a job doing it professionally is not going to be easy.\n\nThat being said, what you need to learn all depends on what type of malware you want to analyze. With binary malware (think Windows malware) you need to be a boss at C and C++, and have a very good understanding of x86 assembly at lest. Binary reversing requires a huge amount of fundamental computing knowledge. www.woodmann.com will get you started with this.\n\nWeb malware is easier to analyze, because you don't have to understand how a processor works to reverse it. I would start with learning Javascript, then go PHP. That should get you started.\n\nI work in the malware analysis field. We need more skilled programmers. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you with learning this stuff.", "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1335063185, "id": "c4f3m3j", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_s6fyq", "ups": 3, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "author": "tux402", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": null, "retrieved_utc": 1428770458, "updated_utc": 1668801446, "body_sha1": "40976e2eb065a0fa862fe8382f0cafb5350bbdc5", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-04-22 02:53:05"}, {"id": "c4ezj8f", "link_id": "t3_sklfr", "created_utc": 1335037838, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "ups": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "parent_id": null, "edited": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "author": "distortednet", "downs": 0, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "body": "Not bad. the 64 bit version of zaccess isn't too much of a pain to deal with. the 32 bit version, however, can go south pretty quickly.\n\neither way, nice tutorial :)", "retrieved_utc": 1428768466, "updated_utc": 1668801443, "body_sha1": "a544109cb9a17510baee61849bfce8f38f003cb0", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-04-21 19:50:38"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 58, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 2, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1334991660000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1335078060000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1334991660000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1335078060000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673945683.810305, "api_request_start": 1674101172.9360955, "api_request_end": 1674101173.0242596, "api_total_time": 0.08816409111022949}}
