FYI, the Elasticsearch is also running under Apache. They aim WebApp flaw in code injection, and in most of cases we confirmed that root privilege was taken. However this malware is not a root kit, so is curable, yet due to the root was taken, the server audit is a must.\n\nIf you would kind enough to paste the backdoor IP addresses and the attacked IP as per we mentioned in the post, it will be a big help to us.
