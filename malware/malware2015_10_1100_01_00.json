It's just a format, no different than the thousands of other standards that are created and widely implemented to save time and reduce complexity in today's society. \n\nSo company A and company B may detect samples differently, but that doesn't mean they can't have the same format of naming, even if the names or classifications don't match. Sure it'll make them change pipelines and cause headaches but it's for the good of the industry. \n\nMy best guess would be that AVs don't adopt this format for the sole reason of branding and sales, and not because it makes sense technically. Their mindset, I'm guessing, is that the the less they inform the customer, the better - at least in regards to detected infections. So because the proposed format by design offers more info than just a random name, AVs instead stick with their own designs where they control the amount of displayed information. \n\nI see it no differently than a doctor telling you you've been shot vs a different doctor telling you what you've been shot with, like a hollow-point round which basically means you're dead. One leaves critical info out to reduce panic and the other is more transparent and honest. \n\nThanks for your reply.

I've ignored a number of your misreadings and grammatical errors because I know what you really meant, and such pedantry doesn't advance the conversation.  There is no embarrassment that stems from this conversation.  You may very well know more than me.  Gaining knowledge from people is the primary benefit of coming to sites like this and conversing with people, and I've had many great conversations with brilliant people.  You aren't one.  Your primary concern is proving to people how much smarter you are than everyone else, and putting people down.  You're the only expert I've ever encountered who is quite so concerned with telling other people that he is an expert.  Usually that kind of thing is self evident.
