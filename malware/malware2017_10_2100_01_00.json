Be careful getting swept up in the anti-Russia propaganda, for further reading I highly recommend you read about some old declassified stuff; J. Edgar Hoover, to get an idea of what type of power the US is potentially capable of exercising right now _in other countries_. Every single revelation that was made on Hoover would have been considered a conspiracy theory in the 1960's. It's no secret now, but after the global surveillance leaks it's practically willing ignorance to not believe they could be doing bad things of similar size right now.\n\nVault7 was a very recent disclosure I'm surprised you didn't know about.
