I was wondering if I replaced my router with a new one, would I still be getting that message, pr of I change my Ip?\n\nIt's hard to say for certain without having identified the device responsible for the compromise. I keep saying that I think it is most likely that your router had it's DHCP configuration changed by some malicious javascript, but you have to find out. You mentioned you have laptops? Use one of those to check your router's config page and let us know what your DHCP configuration says. You may want to PM that info though. Here's a quick guide if you'd rather check it yourself: \n\n1. Go to the config page. It's usually at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 or something. To find out for certain what your router's IP is, run `arp -a` from the command prompt.\n2. I think you'll find the DHCP configuration under \"LAN Setup.\"\n3. Look at the entries \"DNS Server 1\" and \"DNS Server 2.\"\n4. Take those IP addresses (or address if there's just one) and go to [who.is](http://who.is) and enter the IP. If the information you get back says anything other than your ISP's name, that's your problem.\n\nOr, you can give me the IP and I'll check it for you. Either way, that's what you should be doing, not compressing hard drives and rebooting!\n\nOr, if you've got the money to burn and you just want to buy a router because you're a baller like that, then go ahead. That will also probably fix your problem. But of course, you can find out for free if you just follow the steps above.", "score": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392686670, "edited": false, "retrieved_utc": 1432442632, "updated_utc": 1668791159, "body_sha1": "48b317f5214d9b73af7a8cd34b0fe6094f67f7b7", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-02-18 01:24:30"}, {"subreddit": "Malware", "author": "Elias51", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": null, "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "downs": 0, "controversiality": 0, "id": "cfhwk09", "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_1y5f6p", "archived": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "body": "Although not directly related to the technique you initially describe (injecting into a remote process).
