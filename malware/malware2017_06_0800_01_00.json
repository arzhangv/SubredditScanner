A large customer did, without consulting us, and their auditors just accepted whatever the scans returned as fact, instead of parsing through it to determine certain things from a technical perspective, figure out the REAL extent of malware in any of our networks (much much less than 5 pages of historical data reaching back to 2014), get our public IP ranges from us to use, etc. So we have to go through it, point out exactly what was wrong, and why it won't affect them because we are just selling them the product, not hosting it in the cloud (which is an option for our customers). \n\nWe have said report, since our customer furnished it to get answers from us for the grading, but as I wrote, it only gives us our NAT from our networks. Since we're a large company with many systems, we NAT everything at the edge, especially for workstations and guest systems that don't need static IP's, so one NAT'd IP could have 10 - 15 systems behind it, even on the guest networks. \n\nThey also give timestamps, but with only a NAT to go on, and a timestamp, for one of our largest offices in the world, that's pretty much a no-go in tracking them down, especially since no infection is currently detected.\n\nWith the sinkhole list, the timestamp, and the NAT, that would allow me to map explicit guest workstations (and in the rare case the malware reached out from certain networks that are not fully integrated into our corporate networks, our workstations) we can track them down and deal with them as well as point Indian management to where they must actually enforce our security policies.  \n\nHopefully I'm making sense?  if not, it's been a long week :-P", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1496965138, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dingngi", "link_id": "t3_6g2jex", "parent_id": 29425651248, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1499186361, "updated_utc": 1668770649, "body_sha1": "22e1dfde8654b4b00fa1ca0c6288f2f2d5002b2a", "utc_datetime_str": "2017-06-08 23:38:58"}, {"author": "env0ysh3ll", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Awesome.
