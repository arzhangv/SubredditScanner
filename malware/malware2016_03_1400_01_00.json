Came in an email.  Passed through spam filters (verified good sender, spam free).  Cisco Malware scan - passed.  Exchange server malware scan - passed.  Attached to the email was 11-20-2015.zip (or something similar).  The zipped file contained UUE1234567890.js (number sequence hidden).  User launched the jscript.  Microsoft Endpoint Protection real timed it.  ID'd it proper as malware..  Than let it run.  For 1 hour.\n\nIt dropped these:\n\nBackdoor:Win32/Drixed.M          3/11/16 11:11am              Remediated\n\nWin32/Tescrypt.C          3/11/16 11:10am             Remediated\n\nRansom:Win32/Locky.A           3/11/16 11:11am              Remediated\n\nTrojan:Win32/Peals.F!plock           3/11/16 11:11am              Remediated\n\n\nEncrypted most everything on their Windows 7 Pro workstation with a quickness.  Then moved on to encrypting a few hundred documents on several mapped drives too.  .Lockys all over the place.\n\nOddly, Microsoft Endpoint Protection shut it down while it was executing.  Remediated at 11am, but let it run for another hour.  Finally at noon MSEP ID'd it 'malicious activity' and shut it down.   Wth MS?  why so 1 hour later?   Endpoint Protection Definition v1.215.1572.0.  \n\nThe clients network was well secured and segregated which contained the infection to only minor temporary damage.  Powered off the infected workstation, and restored the damaged folders from a backup drive array in 10 minutes.  No loss except some miscellaneous gibberish.lockys on the infected workstation (Must have been dog pictures, otherwise it would be on the home drive, right?).  Workstations off to the lab bench for a fresh rebuild.\n\nThe business owner launched the virus, so owner eats the blame and pays the bill.  But, owner of course didn't open the .zip.  Or double click the .js.  or OK the red warning messages - cause that never happens.  So, today Im stuck with being the dancing idiot explaining how Microsoft Endpoint ID'd it right and proper, but still let it run for one twilight zone hour.  Without stepping on owners toes.\n\nIt's always IT's fault.
