Most would likely it would start doing some nonmalicious stuff to throw off the analysis, but some might try to escape the virtual system to infect the real parent system. Most efforts like this can be kept at bay by ensuring there's no file sharing available between the virtual and the host system, and that all the components on the emulated system are also emulated.\n\nOf course, there might be some malware out there that knows some virtualbox or vmware vulnerabilities for taking over the host system. Due to this you'd still be safer by having a dedicated PC for malware analysis where you run the virtual system.\n\n", "author": "tieluohan", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "link_id": "t3_2xr61o", "parent_id": 27646315541, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "ups": 6, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "id": "cp7zui9", "created_utc": 1425801010, "retrieved_utc": 1427641328, "updated_utc": 1668791878, "body_sha1": "29f6b19beaad8807df2e8e11669f12553b11d233", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-03-08 07:50:10"}, {"parent_id": 27644401353, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_text": null, "archived": false, "link_id": "t3_2uialr", "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "id": "cp7zay9", "created_utc": 1425798908, "edited": false, "ups": 0, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "score": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author": "punkonjunk", "gilded": 0, "score_hidden": false, "body": "\nit could literally be jesus christ himself and it would still be shady.
