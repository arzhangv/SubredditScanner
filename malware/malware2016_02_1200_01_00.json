For a start they are using a legitimate program to run their 'operation'. There probably isn't any malware involved however a deep  scan with your favourite anti-virus software will likely pick any up if said scammer has decided to kindly download any onto your computer for you. \n\nAnd thanks to windows, files on a USB/disc can no longer run as soon as you plug it in (by default on a fresh system). So simply plugging in the pen drive to the new PC won't actually do anything. The malware would essentially be bound to the USB until you move the files off or attempt to execute one of them off the USB. This means you can scan the USB to your hearts content without having to worry about getting re-infected. Remember these people are not elite hackers. They are just scammers.

That said, after you have recovered your files you should run your antivirus/antimalware solution.\n\nI've recently recovered some pdf files that were encrypted by TeslaCrypt using the TeslaDecoder (it is very important that you read the instructions in case the default way doesn't work for you). In my case I had to factor some large numbers and I was able to recalculate the private key so there is hope (asuming that the version that infected you is known by TeslaDecoder).\n\nAlso, don't wipe your machine before you have given up on recovering your files since part of the information needed to decrypt the files is stored in the registry or in %appdata%/key.dat or %appdata%/storage.bin.\n\nIf you upload any encrypted file (filetype ecc, zzz, vvv, aaa,...)
