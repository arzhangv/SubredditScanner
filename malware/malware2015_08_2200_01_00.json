C#) and often used obfuscation, \"crypters\" or process hollowing/forking/RunPE. They scraped the data required from memory and then performed hidden trade requests to the owners.

Chrome is a very good browser to use from a security perspective as it auto updates itself and I think its flash plugin too.\n\nBesides exploits, many of those sites probably have misleading ads and links that try to convince the user to download and install malware themselves. The way to protect against misleading links is to not even show them to the user, or at least to warn them first to be cautious on the site. This is what you described Google as doing.

My fault, I guess. OK, it is nice that you have documented your testing environment. Still, there is much more to be desired. You should also document your testing *methods* - I mean, beyond one-line lists of obscure names. Describe what each one of them does, how it does it, where it is available from and so on.\n\nAlso, you are saying there that you are using \"self-coded (zero-day) malware\". First of all, a bit of explanation here is also necessary. What do you mean by \"zero-day malware\"? Something that uses a zero-day exploit? Or just malware not known to the known-malware scanner component of the AV program?\n\nThe latter question is particularly relevant. I already mentioned this in my previous posts - if the AV program doesn't stop the malware from running \"normally\" (e.g., because it doesn't recognize it as malware), then it is a waste of time to test whether it stops it when run in convoluted ways - it won't, of course.\n\n&gt; Judging by your reddit posting history, you have worked/you are still working with antivirus companies. This explains why are you trying to undermine my tests\n\nMy name is Vesselin Bontchev. Google me. Yes, I've worked in the AV industry for some 15 years. I currently work in the academia; again virus-related work. Before my work for the AV industry, in the 90s, I also worked in the academia - in the University of Hamburg, Germany, where I was one of the first AV testers in the world for some 3 years. So, I know a thing or two about AV testing. I was just giving you helpful advice how to make your tests look professional. You are, of course, free to ignore this advice and stick to the \"raw video and a rant\" format that you currently have.\n\n&gt; do your own tests using the tools I am using and tell me how wrong I am\n\nThe purpose of a test is to reveal something the public normally finds non-obvious or difficult to test themselves. The purpose of a test is to be informative and to educate. The purpose of the test is *not* to say \"Gee, see how 71337 I am, figure it out yourselves, I am the first, I am right, natch\".\n\nFor the record, I never said that you are \"wrong\". The way your test is presented, it is impossible to evaluate that properly. What I *am* saying is that your test results are *badly presented*. It is not sufficiently clear what exactly you are testing, how exactly you are testing it, what exactly is the expected proper behavior (and why), what is observed instead, and how exactly to reproduce the test results. You know, the kind of stuff that makes a test look professional and scientific.\n\n\"If you don't like my test, test it yourself\" is not the proper solution of the problems your test has.", "edited": false, "score": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "distinguished": null, "id": "cubqovv", "link_id": "t3_3hdhd1", "author": "bontchev", "ups": 0, "created_utc": 1440247864, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_text": null, "retrieved_utc": 1441403061, "updated_utc": 1668797721, "body_sha1": "2fd6ccd2ffe822ab886ff9f2d04ffec54effb8b7", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-08-22 12:51:04"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 76, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 8, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1440226860000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1440313260000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1440226860000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1440313260000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673945683.810305, "api_request_start": 1674103942.4727273, "api_request_end": 1674103942.5890949, "api_total_time": 0.11636757850646973}}
