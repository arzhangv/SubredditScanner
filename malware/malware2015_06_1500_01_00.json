Wednesday's report documenting the Duqu 2.0 attacks is no different. Still, it's not hard to read between the lines to paint Israel as a prime suspect.\n\n&gt;While neither the US nor Israel has officially acknowledged any involvement with Stuxnet, New York Times reporter David Sanger's book Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power leaves little doubt the computer weapon was jointly developed by the two countries in an attempt to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment program. Nearly identical code signatures in Stuxnet and the 2011 version of Duqu mean that whoever developed the latter had broad access to the Stuxnet source. And given the work schedules of the Duqu attackers, it seems likely they were physically located in or near Israel.\n\n&gt;Other circumstantial evidence points to Israel. For one, the Duqu attackers targeted participants of the Auschwitz-Birkenau anniversary, an event that was of importance to the Jewish state. And for another, as The Wall Street Journal reported in March, Israel spied on nuclear talks the US and other P5+1 countries convened with Iran. It seems unlikely the US was directly involved in Duqu, since countries rarely spy on their own diplomatic negotiations. What's more, one of the parties targeted by Duqu was at the same time infected by Equation Group, a discovery that suggests the two groups are different and compete with each other. The private report two weeks ago of CVE-2015-2361 to Microsoft by enSilo is another connection to Israel, albeit one that may be only coincidental. Still, two executives of the security company previously worked for Israeli military contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, one of whom previously was a system architect in the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\n&gt;The dual infection also supports suspicions that Equation Group is the work of the NSA or a similar US agency. By contrast, Raiu said, the same group responsible for Duqu has its digital fingerprints on at least three other state-sponsored malware platforms, including Flame, Gauss, and miniFlame.\n\n&gt;Even if Israel wasn't directly involved, there's little doubt Duqu is the work of a wealthy nation-state or at least supported by one.", "link_id": "t3_39xcwv", "controversiality": 0, "author": "r721", "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": 27826993774, "created_utc": 1434394923, "id": "cs7harv", "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1437026365, "updated_utc": 1668795487, "body_sha1": "ba52d877e69193d7643559749abc15461242389b", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-06-15 19:02:03"}, {"author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "downs": 0, "id": "cs7h1ta", "created_utc": 1434394546, "parent_id": null, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "controversiality": 0, "author": "Spooksbuster", "archived": false, "body": "Do we still have no clue about who did that?
