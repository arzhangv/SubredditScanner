You should let the vendors do the initial pitch work.  They have the decks and will always give you the feature their products excel at.  So start there \u2014 ask them for a 2-3 slide deck with the highlights you want.   \n\nBeyond that, some general advice for anyone shopping for Endpoint Protection.  \n\n\u2022 Using Gartner\u2019s labels - Endpoint Protection Products (EPP) is dead.  The future focus and value is with Endpoint Detection and Response tools (EDR).   I would highly recommend you evaluate EDR solutions. That is where your future investments should focus on.  \n\n\u2022 Creat a chart and plot some key components for your comparison.  Such as: \n\n   \u2022 Cost\n   \u2022 Infrastructure requirements \n   \u2022 Management overhead \n   \u2022 Integratione with your platforms/tools/workloads\n   \u2022 Source of Threat Intelligence\n   \u2022 Ease of deployment / Integration\n   \u2022 Performance (Catch rates, false positives, and also usability of the machine with tools running)\n   \u2022 Coverage (Windows Client, Windows Server, Mac, *nix...)\n\nAfter you figure that out from the various vendors, get some trials going and see if you can live with the support and day-to-day with these products.  \n\nA few things to note \u2014 not all anti-malware vendors allow their products to be tested by 3rd parties.   Likewise, 3rd party testing can be a crap shoot and the companies that constantly score high \u2014 are purposefully playing to the test and not necessarily providing more protection. \n\nA few other key components that are often overlooked:\n\n\u2022 People and Process are as or more important than the security tools.  You can\u2019t just buy a security product and becoming magically secure.  \n\n\u2022 You anti-malware that responds/evolved as quick as the malware it is trying to defeat.   You need real-time cloud protection if you want to have any chance of blocking modern malware.  \n\n\u2022 Something will always get past your protection.  Have a plan. Have a multilayered approach.  \n\n\u2022 Have a plan and tools for responding to getting popped.  The more automated the better.  \n\n\u2022 Learn who is using these tools and how. There is always someone out there who is a bigger target than you.  Chances are they\u2019ve already figured out some of this data for you.  \n\nGo through all that \u2014 you should a good solution.
