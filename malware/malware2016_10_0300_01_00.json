The \"mssiq.exe\" appears to be a scrapper (collects data from the infected host) and it also modifies the system to disable normal functionality (the anomalous unhooking of standard Windows functions).\n\nMy belief is that the .ZIP file contained a downloader script (executed by Wscript.exe).

Strengthening my idea that it's for user interaction. It also appears to connect to a table/database. Is this how onedrive's program that links to the cloud normally connect? If so, what else is the same? What else is different?\n\nHowever, in the first image, it looks like the file identifies as an image file, a gif, or at least contains one.\n\nSo my next set of questions are:\n\nWhat is the first 8 bytes, which denote what the full program is?\n\nIf you call the program from the command line, does it present you with a help section? [filename.exe] -h or [filename.exe] /?\n\nFinally, are there any other URL's that might suggest this interacts with OneDrive (or is a onedrive installer?)\n\nJust some food for thought! \n\nEDIT: the first 8 bits may provide enough information.
