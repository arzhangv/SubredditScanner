The bottom line is, Kaspersky did exactly what the Reuters story accused them of, and it's a potential concern, but OP's suggestion is stupid.  As far as your thoughts on Google's irrelevance, I mean, whatever dude.  That's so dumb there's not anything to say.  You say they can't even keep malware out of their play store, as if that is relevant to this.  There's not a company yet that has kept malware out of their store, even in the walled garden of Apple.
