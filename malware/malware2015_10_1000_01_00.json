Sometimes based on familial names if there's confidence it is a derivative, but just as often getting a \"trendy new name\" (to use your term) like Agent or Bot or Trojan.  Creating something with the detail level of a paper takes months of reverse engineers' time.\n\nCompanies don't detect things the same way, they don't classify things the same way, they cannot t always share samples or metadata because customer PII is involved.  Just because it is new to Company A doesn't mean it is new to Company B.  They may not even agree on whether something is malicious.  Some companies classify some programs as potentially unwanted programs, potentially unsafe programs, hacking tools, riskware, and so forth, while others don't have these kinds of classifications at all.  There are also anti-malware companies who have some presence in the software download and paid-search ecosystems, and it seems unlikely that they would classify their own programs and sites as a threat.\n\nYou are correct in that names are arbitrary to some extent, but as it turns out, anti-malware companies do sometimes rename things when its in the public interest to do so.  Conficker is an example of this--and even with that there are still a few companies using the Downadup and Kido names (or at least were, haven't checked recently). \n\nFor that matter, check out the  [CME List](http://cme.mitre.org/data/list.html).  That was the MITRE project to apply standardized naming conventions.  In five years, they managed to create ***39*** entries.  All of which were basically lists of vendor names for deconfliction.\n\nIt just doesn't work.\n\nI understand it is frustrating for people who play with malware trying to figure out how X maps to Y, but as I mentioned earlier, there are tools like Virus Total and VGrep to do deconfliction.  For that matter, check the anti-malware company's threat encyclopedia. They usually list names used by a few competitors as well.\n\nRandom name changes to the threat signature databases used by anti-malware programs would introduce additional testing and QA overhead.  It could also introduce untested cases where the renaming causes a bad signature update.  Crashing all the computers running your software with a bad update can have all sorts of repercussions.\n\nEverybody seems to think that anti-malware software means using signatures.  As Fred Cohen pointed out in his doctoral thesis on computer viruses, behavioral blocking and change detection via checks against stored values are also part of finding malware.  There are very few products left in the space today which rely solely on strings and hashes.\n\nAnti-malware software is actually pretty darn effective.  It's also only one part of a layered defense system.  A lot of people seem to think anti-malware software is some kind of invisible force-field against which viruses and worms and rootkits magically bounce off.  It's not.  It is more like an insurance policy.  You don't go around driving past the speed limit , going through stop lights, etc., because you have car insurance; you get it because there are other idiots out there who do those things.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n\n\n&gt; We get it. Once you find new malware, nobody has seen it before (including heurs) so you create a new malware name. You couldn't possibly still protect your customers without showing them a trendy new name? So without a name, no sig push...\n\n&gt; Placeholders would work just fine for this. If there was an authorized org to create names NOT based on malware characteristics, just a name, and if everyone used this format like Msft does, there would be improvement.\n\n&gt; So McAfee discovers a world-new worm, after analysis they sig it and need a name. So they use an allocation of identifiers that are mapped to names the name org will later generate and assign. For example, Temp: Win32/abce18582.PatientZero would later be named WORM: Win32/FruitScoop.001\n\n&gt; Then the org somehow decides on a name and maps it to the temp sig name above, accessible publicy, API etc. Then all the Avs can see the new revision and change their temp sig names to the more officially named one. And later down the road something changes, because everyone is already synced up, name mapping is a breeze, no different than updating a domain whois or NS registry.\n\n&gt; Because lets be honest, the name is arbitrary, who gives a shit. Bladablindy, gopher whatever! But is my computer protected from the nasty worms out there? I don't care what its called. That's what customers want.\n\n&gt; So this way you can create the sig, push out critical fixes without needing to actually identify or classify the threat, just block it whichever way works. Then once we all decide what the threat was by studying, analyzing and classifying it, a name is given and done. Win for everyone.\n\n&gt; Maybe im crazy, but nobody can disagree that traditional AV aka current day AV needs to change fast, regardless of \"signature\" naming conventions. Practically useless at this point, let's be honest.\n", "subreddit": "Malware", "retrieved_utc": 1446898004, "updated_utc": 1668781162, "body_sha1": "be1bb7fa682cdfc5eb7859e1a566f47003c2dfaa", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-10-11 05:59:53"}, {"controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": false, "link_id": "t3_3nopyb", "author": "goretsky", "created_utc": 1444540606, "parent_id": 28041664840, "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 1, "id": "cvvk19s", "body": "Hello,\n\nIt ***had*** been implemented as the [*Common Malware Enumeration*](http://cme.mitre.org/) (CME) system, which now seems to redirect to `http://maec.mitre.org/`.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n", "subreddit": "Malware", "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1446897563, "updated_utc": 1668781161, "body_sha1": "25302ab4031ed93adfa221ed48303eeb173625d0", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-10-11 05:16:46"}, {"id": "cvvesr3", "body": "Malware is interesting indeed, I'm especially fond of RAT's myself. \n\nIt just depends on what your end goal is, and finding ways to reach it. \n\ntl;dr alot of stuff is really open because people don't lock their doors.
