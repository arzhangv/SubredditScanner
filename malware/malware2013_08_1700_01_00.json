Just because tools like procmon are involved, doesn't mean it doesn't involve analysis. It's just behavioral analysis (which often involves research, by the way), rather than static analysis or reverse engineering. Sometimes all people want to do is figure out what it is they're dealing with and/or how it behaves.\n\nWhen I write up a post focusing on actual reverse engineering, I'll include output from IDA.

It's like you were having a great time playing with your ball before someone took it away from you, and now you're bitter about it.\n\nIDAPro is a great platform... for doing static/code analysis. However, there's far more to malware analysis than just looking at a decompiled sample in IDA. I would argue that static analysis is only important when dynamic analysis fails. The sample is a piece of commodity malware, and the intent of my post was not to reverse engineer it.\n\nEither way, thanks for sharing your opinion and I'm sorry you didn't like the post.
