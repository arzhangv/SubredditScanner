The reason being that the attacker would have had to exploit OP's browser to run code with SYSTEM permissions - which isn't easy and not particularly likely considering he's using Chrome (Google pays &gt;$60,000 for code execution exploits). Then, the attacker would've had to gain SYSTEM or ADMINISTRATOR privileges by migrating to a vulnerable process via heap-spraying or some such - also very hard. Then, it'd be inconsistent and unreliable for the attacker to ensure that the ARP spoofing attack didn't break the network that the victim is on completely. All the while, the ultimate goal of the attacker is to make a profit, so taking such a haphazard approach wouldn't make sense.\n\nContrast that with embedding an iframe pointed at http://192.168.1.1 on your site that uses javascript to manipulate the DOM in that iframe's context. There's a really good chance (like 2:1) that your wireless router sits at 192.168.1.1 and uses a default password (or no passwod). If that's the case, the attacker could simply craft the perfect url such that your DHCP settings get changed to point your DNS at some malicious DNS server. Then, you accomplish (kinda) the same thing as you would have through the ARP spoofing attack in such a way that you can get everyone on the LAN to your site.\n\nI really think it was #1, but until OP delivers we wont know. I really would like to know what his router's configuration page looks like right now.
