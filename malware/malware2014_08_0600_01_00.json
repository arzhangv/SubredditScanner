I mean i know the IT support was poor as you mentioned, but another reason I love worms most (out of viruses and trojans), is how clever the authors are. So many tricks at their disposal, so many ways for something to look completely different. Its great! I really loved learning about polymorphic malware last semester. Oh I also really like either Duqu (and how Kaspersky called it a.k.a \"Steal Everything\") the range of capabilities on that worm is incredible! Thank you so much for your input, even just one response was a lot more than I had hoped for! I really appreciate this, your response opened a door for me to learn more. Thank you again!\n\nEDIT: From the video I watched on sality, its a file infecting worm. We didn't really learn about file infector worms at all in class (we learned about Viruses, but not worms that infect files really)", "removal_reason": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_2ctznx", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": true, "author": "hisep", "gilded": 0, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "archived": true, "score": 3, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "ups": 3, "created_utc": 1407387319, "retrieved_utc": 1435114344, "updated_utc": 1668795944, "body_sha1": "674bf80bcb30cf4532ca57eca581475077b07dc4", "edited_on": 1407387746, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-08-07 04:55:19"}, {"subreddit": "Malware", "score_hidden": false, "score": 3, "distinguished": null, "archived": true, "edited": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author": "Higgle_Wiggle", "gilded": 0, "ups": 3, "created_utc": 1407384826, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Conficker is still around, but not much has been done with it. After a while the creators used it to distribute a rouge antivirus and other spyware but other than that not much else; there are more deadly worms out there, like Win32.Sality. Conficker spreads fast but worms like Sality infect and can damage files. \n\nTL:DR: Conficker didn't do anything big with its potential power, other worms are a bigger concern. \n\nMy favorite piece of malware are worms like Sality and Conficker. How they spread like a wildfire and have the potential to destroy huge amounts of data if utilized quickly is awesome and scary. \n\nEDIT: My highschool had 3 different worms in every computer lab due to poor IT support. Conficker B, Sality, and MyDoom. I have pictures from scanning my flash drive after a few attacks from those worms if you'd like to see them.
