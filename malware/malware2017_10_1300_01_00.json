I never said that - I said that any coin miner is a tool - and tools are neither good nor evil - it depends how they are implemented.\n\nTraditional malware will deliberately attempt break out of its sandbox, drop programs that do 'bad things' (tm) - and modify the host OS in a permanent manner - and they specifically and obviously attempt to work contrary to the desired operation of a web browser.\n\nWeb miners work within the design of a web browser, and they go away when you ask them to (close the tab)\n\nI have an .exe here that mines coins. It's not malware. I'm running it on several of my own machine right now. It's fully labelled as 'coin miner' and it mines coins. Completely legit.\n\nIf I run that tool on your computers does it suddenly become malware? No - it hasnt changed. The tool is not evil. I might be, but the tool isnt.\n\nPersonally I close tabs when I'm done with them. How you choose to work is your business.\n\nI expect that future browser generations will be given a CPU quota per tab - thus completely defeating anything like this.\n\n...but fundamentally - if you come to visit my website, and I present it to you without any unauthorised additions, and you download it, and execute it - do I feel anything morally untoward is happening if I benefit from a few of your CPU cycles while you are looking at the content that I have provided for you?
