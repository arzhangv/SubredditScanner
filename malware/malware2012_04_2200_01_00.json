All the appsec guys I know started as plain software engineers. I did the same thing. I started in web development, then moved to web application security (offensive hacking), then into binary application security (malware research) when I felt ready for it.\n\nKeep an eye out for internships within the security field. Companies are always looking for enthusiastic young talent. What I did when I was in school was send in applications to every security company in my city. I caught a break and got involved with IBM at an early age. Just know, when you are applying for these entry level positions, that it is less about what you know, and more about how you think. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\" Just always follow that up with an explanation on how you might go about figuring it out. \n\nAlso, recruiters like to see that you are going above and beyond with your programming. If you don't program outside of your required work, then that will be looked upon as a major negative in the appsec world. People love to see that you are a self-motivated programmer.\n\nMost people seem to start out with web development stuff because of how easy high-level programming is. But you might be able to skip it if your interest lies mostly in binary security. There are little programs out there called crackmes that people use to practice reverse engineering. Basically, it's a small program that you can crack open and figure out how it works. There are also little programs called keygenmes, which basically is the same thing, but you have to reverse engineer the key algorithm and create your own keygen. You can find a ton of them here, www.crackmes.de\n\nIf you want some good video tutorials, check out www.securitytube.net. You could spend weeks going through all the good material there. It's the youtube of hackers. Start playing with OllyDbg first, then move onto IDA Pro. Those are the two debuggers that all the pros use. Intro video tutorials on those programs can be found there.\n\nIf you want a couple of good books, start with Windows System Programming by Johnson Hart. Then you can check out Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson. Those two will definitely get you started with binary reversing.\n\nOh, and this should go without saying, but always be reversing in a virtual machine.
