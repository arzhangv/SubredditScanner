It isn't dridex or ransomware, it is just the delivery method, a very popular delivery method. As you know it didn't run and without running it in an emulator i can't say for certain what it would do (even if i did i still wouldn't be 100% certain) however i can tell you what these files and this attack method has been doing for the last few months. \n1. You receive a spam email with word/excel file attached\n2. Because you really want to pay that invoice you open the file\n3. If you are a really stupid user you have macros enabled by default without a prompt (even MS think that is bad)\n4. If your an equally stupid user (but has an IT Admin with some common sense) you have to at least confirm you want the macros to run\n5. The file and macros run and you see nothing happen. You go about your day hoping nothing bad comes from this.\n6. Meanwhile that 'downloader' has connected to one of the servers on its list (it works through a list until it finds one it can connect too) and it will download the malware or multiple malwares (not sure malwares is a word?) \n7. The malware is installed on your machine and the damage begins.\n\nSo here are some interesting points:\n- The servers these downloaders connect to are setup and removed very quickly, some only available for a few hours (or less)\n- The servers aren't blocked by many AV companies due to them not being 'known bad sites'\n- If you and a friend ran exactly the same file at the same time you wouldn't necessarily connect to the same server, even if you did you wouldn't necessarily download the exact same malware\n\nAlso you have heard many people mention ransomware, dridex, locky etc. Just to clarify what those are:\nRansomware - it will encrypt your files, preferably as many as it can gets it's hands on, including ones on removable media, mapped network drives/shared folders. It will leave a ransom note, normally in the form of a txt file with instructions on how to pay (some of these can be quite humorous (providing you aren't the victim)). And no the files can't be decrypted, the times when this has been done is normally after the FBI or someone has arrested the game and got hold of the C&amp;C servers with the private encryption keys. Ransomware also runs and then stops, without trying to spread, it will then delete itself making it harder for AV companies to get samples.\nLocky - This is just the newest kid on the block, it encrypts the files and adds a .locky extension. One file of interest that it encrypts is your bitcoin wallet, if you have one. Which would mean you could lose a lot more than just your holiday pics (again if you are studpid enough not to have a backup).\nDridex - This is very different (and imo more impressive from a black hat point of view). This runs in the RAM memory meaning there are no physical files on your machine for this malware, when your computer receives a shut down command it writes the entire dridex malware to a startup location in your registry. When your machines starts up again it runs in RAM memory again and deletes itself from the registry. Oh and it steals your online banking details, so you might want to keep an eye on your balance (from a different computer).\n\nOK well this was far longer than i was planning. anyway hope it helps someone.", "score": 2, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 28308588334, "edited": true, "retrieved_utc": 1458610736, "updated_utc": 1668780358, "body_sha1": "784f99f05723260281642384af2281b4cbeda54f", "edited_on": 1455919605, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-02-19 22:03:07"}, {"controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_45qmzj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "body": "I would imagine that most privilege escalation techniques would leave an easily findable signature in the binary.
