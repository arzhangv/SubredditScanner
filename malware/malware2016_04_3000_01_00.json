I know you got av alerts, but I wouldn't trust it to have completely protected your pc. I know it's a pain, but you really should do a full wipe and reinstall of your pc.\n\nThe super long installation time can kind of be justified though. I'm assuming that \"Ultra Repack\" means that the download you got was heavily compressed. So uncompromising to ~60GiB of data is going to take a long time. However, the other actions are clearly hostile.\n\nIn terms of the attempted registry modification, perhaps they were trying to alter your DNS settings to a hostile server? Use it to redirect you to phishing sites by returning a different ip.\n\nOh I just read your link, hiding a bitcoin miner in the long install time sounds very plausible. Probably much more likely than it just sitting there decompressing.\n\nIf you want to find out what it wanted to do to your pc, I think the easiest way would just be to run it without av, then check those registry values. If you want to see what data it's sending, use Wireshark. Obviously you shouldn't do this on a pc you care about. Maybe do it in a vm? I don't actually know what the best idea here is.\n\nThis is really the risk of piracy though. Especially for a game like The Witcher 3, where the developers release a standalone installer that requires no credentials to run, why would you ever download an unofficial version? Why not just find a torrent of the official installer, and check the checksums?", "retrieved_utc": 1465552257, "updated_utc": 1668782945, "body_sha1": "b2268300ff499dd8282d2b067d567c3fdcc9181d", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-05-01 01:46:46"}, {"author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "created_utc": 1462010036, "stickied": false, "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "mjuad", "id": "d2n6h75", "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_4gtpru", "ups": 1, "body": "Read the sidebar.
