Stuxnet was 'wrapped' in an MP3 file, which the user copied onto their flashdrive so they could play music at work (the nuclear plant didn't have internet access for those systems). It wasn't IN the USB drive's firmware per say.\n\nIf you are asking about FIRMWARE malware, such as found in hard drives (not the storage area) or a USB device (again, not the storage area) that is also slightly different. Firmware malware (when discussing storage devices, not something like a router) is typically inserted by a malicious supply chain component, not a random virus. It CAN happen, mind you, but it probably will not. But the malware has to have code to attack said firmware, which is often incredibly specific and not something all malware variants that might attack your PC would contain.\n\nBut if you are simply asking whether or not something can attack the firmware itself (and do not plan on moving data between the computers by burning it) then it's not very likely your DVD drive would be targeted. \n\nIf you are worried about that, google the make and model with something like \"Firmware attacks\" or \"firmware malware\", but again it probably won't happen just because you have a computer that is infected. Malware which attacks an operating system like Windows or Linux probably won't contain code to attack that DVD player.\n\nDoes my response help or am I not getting what you are asking?", "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "Sam-Gunn", "score": 2, "link_id": "t3_5n6wle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1485938932, "updated_utc": 1668776411, "body_sha1": "2bd048e8e4046ecc52ae64b5dd37cd115cd702f8", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2017-01-10 19:39:51"}, {"id": "dc94inr", "edited": false, "parent_id": null, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1484075867, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_5n5g2i", "score": 7, "author": "drmacinyasha", "subreddit": "Malware", "gilded": 0, "stickied": false, "body": "In other news, *water* is *wet*.\n\nRemember kids, don't install APKs from untrusted sources.
