And even when the developers are arrested  isn't it usually because they're using their own product?\n\nI've read that in Russia until the arrest of Paunch, it was widely assumed that as long as you were only a developer, you weren't going to have much difficulty - especially if the malware intentionally avoided targeting CIS countries.\n\nEven with Paunch though, users had the option to have him host their exploit kit for like $50/day.  I haven't been following the case very closely, but surely this negates any claim he can make that he was *unaware of what his users were doing* - RAT authors on the other hand, probably can say this.\n\nSome countries have laws about developing malicious software, some are more strict and all-encompassing than others, but unless somebody's owned the developers' machine or something and can prove illegal activity, there's always something else at play.\n\nIt could be said that Stephen Watt was purely a developer and had no knowledge of what his sniffer program was being used for in Gonzalez' breaches, however given his past activity, the legal world had it out for him.  They also had clear statements identifying him as the one who modified the code used in TJ Maxx breach.\n\nThere was an *APT* campaign discovered a while ago in which a C&amp;C host was compromised and was found to be hosting source code of the RAT it was using.  The analysts traced messages in the code to a repo of a telecom company in China, and doxed (not publicly) the author.  Had this author been in the west, you can be pretty certain they'd have gotten a visit from men in suits or something, but depending on how deployment was found to be managed, there might not be much the feds could do about it.\n\nAs far as I know, the following hasn't been a main piece of evidence in any case, but there are signatures generated by a machine and compiler that along with other metadata.  This still relates to distribution though, and not necessarily directly to the author.\n\nI would be interested to read up on a malware author who was arrested purely for writing malware without any other connection to the clients for which they wrote it.", "distinguished": null, "id": "cgg7fye", "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "created_utc": 1396239709, "score": 5, "edited": true, "subreddit": "Malware", "link_id": "t3_21sn9g", "parent_id": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "author": "nah00m", "removal_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1433142716, "updated_utc": 1668792492, "body_sha1": "5085271ebe76b37a5746f33dd161e51858afe257", "edited_on": 1396241161, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-03-31 04:21:49"}, {"link_id": "t3_21sn9g", "edited": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "id": "cgg79hn", "gilded": 0, "created_utc": 1396239222, "score": 8, "archived": true, "score_hidden": false, "ups": 8, "body": "Follow the money.", "removal_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "author": "Gadsden", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": null, "retrieved_utc": 1433142631, "updated_utc": 1668792492, "body_sha1": "a150c41a772cd46726a8d0f5f0dff90beba7d6bd", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-03-31 04:13:42"}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": 27115990729, "author": "Crash_says", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "removal_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 15, "score_hidden": false, "body": "ZeuS isn't a single piece of malware, it has been in development a decade and was \"open sourced\" in 2010 which is why there are literally hundreds of ZeuS developers and crews.
