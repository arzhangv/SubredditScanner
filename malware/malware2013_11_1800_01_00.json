Sometimes you come across a malware for which you have to learn yet another runtime/environment/SDK and it gets tedious. There's also a never ending stream of malware so sometimes it feels like fighting windmills.\n\nIn the end, you definitely need to enjoy cracking some malware apart, because this is the only reward you'll get. If you don't enjoy solving puzzles, I don't think sitting in front of IDA/OllyDbg for 8 hours a day will stay enjoyable for long.\n\nAlso, you need to understand that poking at malware at home vs. poking at it at work is a different beast. At home you can work as slow as you want, take breaks, do other stuff. At work someone else is expecting results and there is enough malware to keep you busy until you die, so it feels stressful at times.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1384783264, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": null, "id": "cdh4et5", "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": false, "retrieved_utc": 1428611293, "updated_utc": 1668791232, "body_sha1": "9bb85be00f973f50a00390c824bf9ba04b705593", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2013-11-18 14:01:04"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 70, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 1, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1384761660000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1384848060000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1384761660000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1384848060000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.2578893, "api_request_start": 1674102267.3435576, "api_request_end": 1674102267.4658844, "api_total_time": 0.12232685089111328}}
