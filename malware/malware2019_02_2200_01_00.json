I'd recommend the following:\n\n**Know what questions to ask** You don't start an analysis without a goal. Generally in a company that goal is one of the following, most common first:\n\n* Knowing if the malware specifically targetted the company or if it was part of a larger wave.\n\n* Knowing generally how the malware attacks (ie: C&amp;C, protocols, ports...) to know how to fight it.\n\n* Knowing what the malware attacks in order to know what could have been compromised.\n\n* Determining a characteristic signature of the malware to detect it more easily in the future.\n\n* Knowing how the malware is structured to detect analyze it more easily in the future.\n\n* Knowing in details how it works to the point where you're able to rewrite it and reuse it.\n\nDetailed reverse engineering is something that is very very much uncommon. Generally what you want is only a global idea: \"Is my company name or ips in the binary? What ports and ips is it trying to join ? Is that an IRC bot (ie: can I find things like JOIN, PING or PRIVMSG in the binary) ?\". None of those questions actually require reading assembly generally, especially if you use dynamic analysis.\n\n**Consider focusing on dynamic analysis for a while** In real life you need to use all the tools at your disposal to get the job done so you should learn DA anyway. Furthermore RE is *much* easier when you know what behaviour you're expecting from the malware, and as said before you generally don't need detailed RE to answer the question the company is needing an answer to.\n\n**Read [RE for beginners](https://beginners.re/)**. This is not focused on analyzing malwares so you don't fiddle with obfuscation etc. This book is about becoming fluent in assembly to the point where you can see some code and say \"Ah, this is a loop that goes through a list of structs organized as such and when it finds it it does a switch to do different things so that field must be an enum of some kind that has at least this much elements that correspond to this and that\". If the book isnt your style at least start reading it to understand its method then you can work on your own, it's very effective. I recommend it before any \"analysis\" book because there's no point learning about obfuscation and such if you're not able to read basic assembly with ease.\n\n**Read Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering** There are other books but I'll talk about what I know. This book does some things that the previous doesn't:\n\n* it focuses on windows (which is a plus if you're working on malwares since most malwares are windows-based).\n\n* it teaches about reverse engineering of file formats (which extends very very easily to network protocols). This is *very* important and useful, and one of the few cases where RE really shines more than DA.\n\n* it teaches about obfuscation and adversarial tricks to make reversing harder, especially cases where DA is not possible because there are runtime checks etc.\n\n**Work work work**. No secret here.\n\nFORGOT: **Choose tools and work with them frequently** On linux my choice goes to radare2, it's free and very very good once you learn its terse interface.

Keep working through it. I'd also recommend the Malware Analysts Cookbook as another great resource.

Just understand that by no means is it an actual reversing course. \n\nStatic analysis via disassembly is rad, but know that the ability to analyze malware via this method and make sense of it is not a common nor easy skill.
