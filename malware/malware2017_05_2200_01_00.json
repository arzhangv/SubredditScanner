I do however do both of these things regularly for fun and profit*\n\n1.1 yes, I suggest x86 first, it's a bit easier and there is a ton of resources out there to get you start.  x86_64 isn't that much more difficult to learn once you get x86 generally understood... basically larger registers and more of them meaning func calling conventions are slightly different.  Once you move into more \"exotic\" architectures (ARM/MIPS/etc.) there is some common understanding of how ASM works, and you get more comfortable with it... but you basically still need to heavily consult the manuals and such... the instruction sets and calling conventions (IMO) differ enough that the skill sets aren't a \"learn one and know them all\" kinda deal.  On a side note this is a great place to start: http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html\n\n1.2 ASM is ASM IMO, I initially learned (and continue to learn) on Linux and can dig through Windows binaries without too much trouble but the calling conventions and familiarity with the Win32 API will go along way... but at the end of the day... the ASM isn't all that much different.  Also depending on what you're getting into, Linux malware is still fairly popular... you won't find it in a phishing campaign or ransomware, but botnets and such spend a lot of their time hijacking IoT and Servers... which are typically Linux based.\n\n2.1 This boils down to personal preference.  I prefer Linux with Linux/Windows VMs.  That said, the Windows version of IDAPro IMO is the best, so I have 1 VM dedicated to just having IDA.  I then  have additional Linux/Windows VMs, fresh and clean with all tools I'll need and then snapshot, which I typically clone and then infect for dynamic analysis purposes.  The IDA VM however never sees execution, it's used purely for static analysis...I've come across malware in the wild that attempted to steal IDA keys.  The host OS (for what I hope are obvious reasons) also never sees execution of malicious binaries.  A lot of folks for example like OS X for the host machine with Win and Nix VMs for analysis.\n\n2.2 You can take an off the shelf toolchain if you like, I prefer to build mine out in both Win and Nix.  The toolsets are getting more mature and such now as well, radare2, binaryninja, IDA, hopper, olly/immunity, x64dbg, gdb (with gef/peda), etc. etc. etc... it really boils down to what you like and what you find works the best for you.\n\nedits: I type like an idiot.", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1495482835, "distinguished": null, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "id": "dhwef71", "link_id": "t3_6cnah2", "parent_id": null, "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1496737830, "updated_utc": 1668771790, "body_sha1": "80ac8943ad6c28d7220e86a3d42f60ff14d4a551", "edited_on": 1495483291, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2017-05-22 19:53:55"}, {"author": "smartowlick", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I'm in the process of building a home lab for just what you described.
