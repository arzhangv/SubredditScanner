I have been at it for less than a year, but it's one of multiple areas I have experience in that are all complementary. \n\nRight now, I'm debating on making it a focus versus just maintaining it as a skillset.  While I would find it technically satisfying to specialize in RE, it could also limit my career choices (especially when considering vertical growth, i.e. leading a team, growing a services, leading a department).  \n\nCompanies that focus on this are AV companies (as /u/bluepostit and /u/rkdc mentioned), US defense contractors  (noted by /u/sk_leb), and professional services firms (i.e. big four).  Larger companies, in my experience, have people who can do this work but I have rarely seen people who focus on it.\n\nFundamentally, there are two ways to analyze: Behavioral and code-based.  Behavioral is running the malware and observing it in a controlled environment (i.e. sandbox) and code-based is running a sample through a disassembler or debugger and understanding its function.  Start with the behavioral, and eventually you'll encounter a piece of malware that won't run (or at least not how you expected) and you'll want to venture deeper to know why.  That will lead you down the road to code-based analysis.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions. :)", "author": "Bilson00", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "ups": 3, "score_hidden": false, "score": 3, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "id": "cdf363p", "retrieved_utc": 1428647101, "updated_utc": 1668791163, "body_sha1": "ae68b9be629301fdd936449462c53a8090c9f7c8", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2013-11-15 18:07:13"}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author": "zyket", "body": "I think checkpoint security have internships and they analyse a lot of malware.", "created_utc": 1384537950, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "parent_id": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "link_id": "t3_1qmrou", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "id": "cdf2s9s", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1428647280, "updated_utc": 1668791163, "body_sha1": "89525a5e7734f8f4e09b3cd645b58e635d892b20", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2013-11-15 17:52:30"}, {"link_id": "t3_1phask", "author": "rustbucketdiaries", "archived": true, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": false, "ups": 1, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "id": "cdf1n0r", "created_utc": 1384535328, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "body": "Didier Stevens has done a lot of work in PDF Analysis.
