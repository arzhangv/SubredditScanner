The problem is that job candidates usually go through a generic HR process before talking to someone in the field you would be applying for.    HR probably won't be able to judge you, so they just look for certs, degrees, years of experience.  If you fit a certain number of criteria they'll advance you to a real interview where the certs and degree don't matter as much, but without passing the first person you'll never get a foot in the door.\n\nFor example, I'm a pentester at my current job with no degree, only CISSP, and no experience in anything on the job listing.  I had a friend who works there, he got my foot in the door and I skipped straight to the technical interview even though HR wouldn't have even considered me.\n\nCerts can also matter if you are doing contract work.  Your company may have full faith in your ability to do your job, but a lot of customers will want contractors to have specific certs so they can be covered.  I've been doing pentesting for about 5 years now and my company wants all of the pentesters, some with more experience than me, to get CEH, an entry level joke of a certification, because so many customers require any contractors they hire to have the cert.\n\nIf you don't have connections, certs can get you past HR, just like connections can help you if you don't have certs, but without one or the other, it is hard to get in the industry, and its hard to make connections if you can never get in the door in the first place.", "id": "cuyhgiz", "edited": false, "link_id": "t3_3kksmw", "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": 27993254236, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "ups": 9, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "score": 9, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1442014384, "author": "dx87", "subreddit": "Malware", "retrieved_utc": 1444308145, "updated_utc": 1668798347, "body_sha1": "9267ecb62ffa13074fe2301f9a15fae8acfaafc5", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-09-11 23:33:04"}, {"ups": 6, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "score": 6, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created_utc": 1442012992, "author": "ZaarinTakesTheBait", "subreddit": "Malware", "id": "cuygqfr", "body": "I have a masters for IR and forensics (I had a bachelors in a completely unrelated field and decided to make a switch).
