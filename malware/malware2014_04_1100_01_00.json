Here's some things that have helped me to get where I am:\n\n* I have a Computer Science Degree\n* I got CompTIA's Sec+ cert (which is easy as certs go) before I started applying for internships/jobs (I even got an elective credit for it as an independent study)\n* I played with Linux and making some scripts to do common tasks on my own\n* As soon as I heard about any related internships, I relentlessly pursued them. I made sure to mention my cert and my related hobbies.\n* Identified the malware people at the company I ended up interning for and asked them questions all the time\n* Took any training that was offered to me\n* Was offered a full time job as a security analyst after I graduated.\n\nFor the last 4 years, I've done malware analysis, statistical analysis, network analysis, software development, systems integration, network engineering, testing and evaluation, and system administration tasks in various environments. My current day to day task is malware analysis.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest for you going in to college:\n\n* Honestly, I feel that a computer science degree will get you the furthest towards the advanced Malware skillz: Reversing binary assembly code back to human-readable code. Basically you want a bunch of C/C++ programming classes.\n* Join your college's closest thing to a \"Computer Security club\" (if there isn't one, start one. Be active.)\n* Create your own instance of Cuckoo at home (you'll need to know your way around linux and Windows as well as python programming)\n* Get access to some malware, I use virusshare.com, submit it to cuckoo, see what happens\n* Look at getting a related cert (GREM, CREA, Sec+/CEH if you're looking to go into the defense industry) These will put you head and shoulders above the other new college grads who haven't even heard of these certs yet, because they're not required yet.\n* Learn x86 assembly, It's complicated and scary at first but when you get into reversing malware in windows environments, you'll swim through oceans of it.\n* Learn the wonders of the sysinternals toolsuite\n* Learn what's normal on a fully updated windowsXP/7 machine. Normal processes, services, registry keys, files, folders, etc.\n\nPlease, feel free to PM me with any other questions you have. I'll answer any that I can.", "subreddit": "Malware", "score_hidden": false, "controversiality": 0, "score": 1, "archived": true, "removal_reason": null, "created_utc": 1397270633, "downs": 0, "author": "Rokhmal112358", "link_id": "t3_225xcb", "retrieved_utc": 1433318558, "updated_utc": 1668792863, "body_sha1": "e408da0cbcd81620e0c52ede8025caddcf084f40", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-04-12 02:43:53"}, {"parent_id": 27132958306, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "id": "cgqam7x", "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "ups": 2, "body": "Thanks for the tip.
