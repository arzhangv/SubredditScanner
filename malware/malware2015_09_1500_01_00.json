I meant that some kinds of heuristic detection are faster than conventional scanning, some have about the same speed, and some are slower. So, you can't claim universally that \"a heuristic-only scan is slower than a conventional-only scan\". That *might* be the case but not because all heuristic scanning is slower but because *some* heuristics are very time-consuming and waste most of the time.\n\nThat aside, there *are* heuristics that speed up scanning - but they aren't used for actual detection (only for deciding which objects to scan and in how much detail) and I wasn't talking about them.", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": 28000329123, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "distinguished": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "gilded": 0, "created_utc": 1442348089, "author": "bontchev", "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1444381888, "updated_utc": 1668798460, "body_sha1": "5fa1a134e819c8988fdc1041fc0d0e255c6abede", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-09-15 20:14:49"}, {"created_utc": 1442346931, "author": "bontchev", "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "parent_id": 27999975476, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_3l0ved", "id": "cv2p8af", "body": "&gt; signature detection scans the virus for strings that are known to be in other viruses\n\n\"scans the *program*\" - it doesn't know if it's a virus yet.\n\nYes, you could say that but with the caveat that practically no contemporary scanner works this way. \"Scanning for strings\" (or, more exactly, relying on it) is something we gave up on more than two decades ago - although most people still think that this is how scanners work. The only exceptions I can think of are ClamAV (which is a horrendously bad scanner made by people without a clue) an YARA (which is an illustrative tool that lets researchers share malware detection data but is not a professional scanner).\n\nIt's not that such strings aren't used at all - it's that we don't rely on them for detection. For instance, the product I worked on used 8-byte strings when scanning some objects (executable files, boot sectors). What happened if the string was **not** found? Nothing, the scanner didn't report anything. What happened if the string **was** found but no other conditions were met? Nothing, the scanner didn't report anything.\n\nBasically, these strings were used only to tell the scanner \"there is something fishy about this file, start inspecting it in earnest\". If you want, they were used as a kind of negative heuristic - their absence told the scanner not to waste any time on scanning the object with a particular set of algorithms, while their presence told the scanner to start inspecting the object more carefully, using a particular set of powerful detection and identification algorithms.\n\nAnd, for some objects, like macros in documents, scan strings weren't used *at all*; we used hashes of the macro bodies instead.", "edited": false, "retrieved_utc": 1444381511, "updated_utc": 1668798459, "body_sha1": "b19809aa9b898bff2f9a5ce51ef38add1dd7bd17", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-09-15 19:55:31"}, {"score": 3, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "ups": 3, "author": "deejayR3R3", "subreddit": "Malware", "created_utc": 1442345488, "author_flair_css_class": null, "link_id": "t3_3l0oso", "edited": false, "id": "cv2o883", "body": "I could be mistaken but I don't think decreasing scan times was a goal of heuristic scanning.
