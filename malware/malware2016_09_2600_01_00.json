Googling the classifications will give you an idea of what the malware does. \n\n\nEdit: looking back at the log,#43 has desktop.ini which is a desktop shortcut so it could have been a RAT that had a second desktop like you originally suspected but thats really just an assumption I can't be fully sure. \n\n\nDue to the fact that we can only see the malware paths and classifications it's hard to pinpoint the exact type of malware it was.
