With the crash of ad revenue from those, most of them have gone to \"software wrapping\" business models, e.g., taking the software you want, and placing a loader or shell in front of it that installs potentially unwanted applications, adware and other garbage they can get paid to install.\n\nA partial solution to this is go to directly to the author's site, instead of download sites like CBS Interactive's CNet Download.Com, etc.  I say *partial*, because a few software authors monetize directly by bundling PUAs, adware or other \"third-party offers\" that no wants directly into their installers.  Examples of these include Adobe Flash and Sun Java, both of which reportedly make between $20-30M a year (each) from bundling crapware with their frameworks.\n\nAnyways, if you CDex, here's the author's web site:\n\nAuthor's site:  http://cdex.mu/  \nAuthor's download page:  http://cdex.mu/download  \n\nI don't think they bundle anything with their direct downloads, but please check yourself to make sure.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n\nP.S.

So the entries MS has for their MS Threat Center for Alureon are quite generic, and appear to be only useful if your Windows Defender finds the malware and reports it as that name. Even the entries themselves seem to only state what components Alureon MAY contain, not what it always does.\n\nThat is quite confusing... Do these whitepapers you've read mention the hash values of the malware in question? If so, I'd search around based on the MD5 hash. If you dont know, you can try opening another thread here asking for analysis of specific variants and/or ways to identify which have what components.\n\n&gt;Would it be a reasonable assumption that most people to ever have malware probably had their entire internet history stolen??\n\nIt depends on the malware! I doubt every infection would attempt to find those files if they were not needed. \n\nApparently variants of Alureon did this (as well as other TDSS variants, read this: https://securelist.com/tdss/36314/)\n\nBecause then they could find websites users frequented, and spoof some of the more common banking ones by performing a sort of man in the middle attack where the bank page served (by the malware) is given to the user instead of the real bank page.
