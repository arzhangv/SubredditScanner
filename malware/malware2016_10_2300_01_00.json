The way wine works is all DLLs are recoded according to their documented API so there are sometimes differences between what's been recoded and what is provided by windows. However the conversion to look like a proper windows environment is done (path conversion to win paths etc...). I checked, there is no access to other files (.doc etc) at this point because it's only the loader. The malware itself does look for such files.\n\nI've come to discover something else though: using a DLL roughly converted to an EXE by just switching the \"is file a DLL\" flag *does* work to some extent. In a windows VM the file is executed and the malware is decrypted and loaded in memory. However it is not executed. This is very interesting and I think  I'll use this technique again in the future.\n\nI still don't understand why it doesn't work with wine but I'm investigating. It looks like the library is loaded, the function is called but it somehow returns before doing anything... As it's loaded at a different place each time I've got some trouble debugging it but I have hope.\n\nFun problem!", "parent_id": 28848526397, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author": "cym13", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "id": "d944oje", "retrieved_utc": 1478816452, "updated_utc": 1668777110, "body_sha1": "36c38b6632df37995945c9816f7a68fd065b75ac", "utc_datetime_str": "2016-10-23 11:45:33"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 45, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 3, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1477206060000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1477292460000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1477206060000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1477292460000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.1513922, "api_request_start": 1674105072.6023397, "api_request_end": 1674105072.6744256, "api_total_time": 0.07208585739135742}}
