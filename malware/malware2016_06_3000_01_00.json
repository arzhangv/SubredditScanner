When the payload (ransomware downloader file..mostly javascript) was firstly distributed in attachment files in email, they mostly undetected by antivirus or filtration system. The downloader will then downloading the crypted version of the locky ransomware (if you got hit between Jun 27th to today), which also was having zero antivirus detection and start to install its ransom activities. \n\n\nThe 151.236.17.47 93.170.123.219 are the callback CNCs, wlong with other ip addresses, they used to serve like 5 set of CNC in a one infection campaign. where they fetch the ransom instruction &amp; made the registration for victims. You should block every CNC announced in these series or in many other research media to avoid that.  66.109.30.133  and 88.214.193.98 are the hacked sites contains the payload of locky, this is why I am sure you got hit by email attachment.\n\n\nThere is also other method infection, drive by malicious web traffic, which is powered by several exploit kits, this type of infection will trick people to click a bogus url to be forwarded to infection sites and install the locky ransomware using vulnerable browser or its plugins. But I think in your case it is not the case.\n\nKeep an eye for infosec news to which sometiems it was announced the decryption method for several specific ransomware, which this may can help you.\n\nPlease do not forget to report to law enforcement, we need that report to form a damage allegation for a crime case to be used to make legal accusation to the actors who are living in the \"bad-bad-land\" far from our jurisdiction &amp; by default..they never care for our damage. And the most important thing is, do not pay the ransom, please, the every dime they received is a gasoline for them to grow further like we are feeding a cancer.\n\nHope this helps.
