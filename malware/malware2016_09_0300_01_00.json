You know, the **REAL** basics: Does it just look for UPX and if so does it look for legitimate unpacked content?\n\nOnce you've gotten that down, you can start to explore some other truly basic questions about it's operation: Does it use a custom unpacking routine that won't give an attacker instant `NT/AUTHORITY` just by automatically 'scanning' (a total nightmare)? Does it hook every process with standard Windows facilities? Does it install an SSDT or other kernel mode hook coded with similar quality standards (and billions of static analysis research) that Microsoft performs? Even if this is the case, it opens the conversation to philosophical questions concerning the strength of common access and if Cylance is simply opening up new, terrifying vistas of insecurity.\n\nThere are hundreds of snake-oil security salesman and unfortunately they usually share Cylance's current tactics. Ultimately the biggest concern I have isn't technical at all. There are people attending conferences and evaluating security systems, that, if presented with an endpoint security system that could evade all contemporary hacking techniques, would quite literally pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a solution. Why isn't Cylance securing these contracts? Why isn't Cylance the talk of the town? Why isn't Cylance *THE* place to submit your resume as a hacker?\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI did a bit of research and the primary guy is the the man behind \"Hacking Exposed\", which I last read when I was 13 so forgive me if I'm off-base here, but I recall it as literally a listing of out-of-date hacking tools with no explanation of operating system internals (I'm excluding the little picture of a \"stack\" which was perfunctory of hacking books made at the time). The other guy seems to be affiliated with McAfee in some fashion and was somehow involved in the very well-known security firm eEye.\n\nThese guys truly could be headed for a breakthrough, but looking at what they've done in the past and what they're posting today, they don't have the \"feel\" of someone conducting groundbreaking research.\n\nAlthough, once again, I'm happy to be proven wrong.", "score": 0, "edited": true, "distinguished": null, "link_id": "t3_50z79f", "id": "d78vq4p", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "author": "zefyear", "parent_id": 28736247125, "ups": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "created_utc": 1472971103, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "retrieved_utc": 1475318792, "updated_utc": 1668787604, "body_sha1": "1c3838b8a8361b4fd654335a8c99268a523348d7", "edited_on": 1472973325, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-09-04 06:38:23"}, {"parent_id": 28735595166, "author": "de_hatron", "ups": 2, "subreddit": "Malware", "stickied": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1472967956, "gilded": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "score": 2, "body": "Now I'm imagining feeding the thing it's own binary and watching universe to implode.
