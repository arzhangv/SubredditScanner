But I think you're on the right track by starting with the basics of C and ASM.\n\nAnother thing I would recommend, when you're first starting, stick with a single OS and cpu architecture and make sure you have a way to compile, disassemble, execute, and debug for that architecture. Once you get pretty familiar with one architecture and os, start expanding out and learn the others out there.\n\nFor me, the progression looked something like this (the first two don't even require knowledge of ASM):\n\nC# -&gt; Android Java RE -&gt; Linux x86 -&gt; Linux x64 -&gt; Windows x86/x64 -&gt; ARM -&gt; ARM64\n\nBut the order probably doesn't matter, probably best to just start with whatever the books you are following along with use. I think sometimes it's recommend to start with a simple architecture like ARM or MIPS instead of Intel based architectures, but I personally was find starting with Intel 32bit.
