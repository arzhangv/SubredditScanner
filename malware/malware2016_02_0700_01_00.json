And from what I can see from the images it's because there technically isn't any. Most of these scammers will actually use legitimate programs for this very reason.\n\n4) The software they use is developed by a company called LogMeIn. They are a legitimate company who offer free and premium networking services. In this case, access to a remote desktop (Your computer). \n\n5) Disconnect from the internet. (Pull the cord, turn your router off, walk 50 meters down the street, idc just make sure it isn't connected)\nInsert a disc/flash drive.

They are predicated on the idea that security is a boolean proposition; that there is only a right and a wrong way to approach it.  It goes on to make the point that many commercial security organizations may be spinning past/current phenomenon in a manner that will generate business, and that this is wrong.  Again, black-and-white, true-or-false, 0-or-1.\n\nThe problem with this stance is that *it* is wrong.  Infosec -- like most things -- is all grey area.  Commercial security companies exist to sell product, so they obviously benefit from the problems they are highlighting.  But so often folks in this industry forget that they are often representing businesses themselves, and that the commercial security companies understand the lingua franca of these circumstances.  They recognize that they are in business largely because of the massive failures of the commercial sector to properly secure their organizations.  They also know that the reasons for these failures are seldom willful negligence or malice; but the complexities of doing business at scale.  Political, financial, strategic, and technical barriers -- along with pure lack of awareness -- are often the reason for these compromises.  By releasing case studies, whitepapers, press releases, and other content like those described here, they increase awareness and provide those tasked with securing these organizations with the vital leverage they need to overcome these barriers and improve their security posture.  The value of reminding leadership that security isn't an occasional need, but a BAU problem is immense, therefore the reports discussed here have great value -- whether they are rehashing things, misrepresenting them, or otherwise exaggerating the attacks they highlight.\n\nYou can count on one hand the number of programs critically reading these reports for emerging gaps in their defensive strategy, and dismissing things they already have covered.  For most, these rehashes of old-as-new are still useful.  Are there ethical problems with this approach?  Perhaps.  But nowhere is it written that the company who drew attention to an issue is the only one able to solve it.  Any intelligent organization will recognize a gap and then employ a mature approach to solution selection and deployment to address that gap.\n\nIf you believe in the idealistic, altruistic approach to security, then you're rightfully going to take issue with these companies, and the reports they publish.  However, if you've done this a while, you'll know that both of these -isms coupled with human nature are bound to disappoint you.  Consider a bit of pragmatism instead, and couple it with some old fashioned hacker creativity.  Maybe then you find a way to make the business models of these companies do what you need them to do, not what they were intended to do.", "author_flair_css_class": null, "stickied": false, "created_utc": 1454871724, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1458349345, "updated_utc": 1668779922, "body_sha1": "bebfcfa5e6ebd0ecb3d236af1b132e21fa36e961", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-02-07 19:02:04"}, {"controversiality": 0, "link_id": "t3_44i8iz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "body": "I definitely do not have the answers, I think the misinformation campaigns can be solved by more scrutiny in our field from the community.

There will be risk for the bad actors to see what we know, but, it is a game of numbers now. To kill a \"hush hush..pay me and you MAYBE will get some info\" that is making our market and our children and also our law so stupid to know what malware can do... which is just wrong, and we won't make it right that way.\n\nFurther, monetizing the threat protection is the problem that we have to deal actually now. \n\nThe original mission WAS: To prevent some infection is only the temporary state BEFORE the bad actors will be caught by the law &lt; theoretically speaking.\n\nWhat happened now is, threat protection is becoming a monopoly industry, they have every budget needed to preserve the best technology the money can buy, they also keep malware information .. yet they spread any information they want, they can brainwash people instead educating them, THIS is the, likely, the case.  Even they do not educate law enforcement to be better in catching or building the case for the malware incident. Our good judges in courts are BLANK about the warrant that they have to deal with, and the problem is.. that MONOPOLY OF INFORMATION of malware.  Yep, in business-like,  the \"industry\" is securing their position that way, yet killing the public right's of COMMON SENSE from the bad stuff that is aiming them. This is why any bad media are all over the places now. \n\nThe problem is, bad guys are knowing these too, \"industry\" is actually being out-run now but they are to way \"arrogant\" to face this. This is why most AV doesn't have resource to investigate ELF malware well, coz they are really flooded with the windows and mobile ones already. NUMBERS is the key. Monopoly of limited amount of people will break the industry by itself,  Bad guys know that. And bad guys know too how Market are being blinded in common-sense, PoC? Look at the nowadays threat.. there all go to extortion, ransom, and stealing for asking money to disclosure..  people's weak common sense in understanding what was going on is aimed. \n\nAnd this is just a beginning, a result of what INDUSTRY has made by these old +/- 20years.\n\n\u2191Stuffs to be fix, I don't say is easy but I am on it.
