Wiping and rebuilding each system is my suggestion, and it sounds like you've attempted this already. But if you're getting reinfected, you'll have to carefully reconsider the methods you are taking to wipe and rebuild these systems. Maybe a small oversight has been the reason why you were reinfected.\n\nI can't know all of the variables, but, some things to consider include (1) are you installing Windows from a trusted source? An example of a copy that is reasonable to trust is one that you purchased legitimately, preferably new, from a reputable retailer; (2) when installing the OS, are you reformatting the drive entirely or just overwriting the OS files that are present (the latter is insufficient to eliminate malware on the system)?; (3) do you download and apply all Windows Updates for the OS before using the system for anything?; (4) are you installing any third-party software that has not been obtained from a trusted source (as in #1), or is perhaps legacy software that is no longer receiving security updates?; (5) are you using unique strong passwords for each system, never reusing a password that has previously been used (write them on a piece of paper if you need to)?; (6) are you restoring any executable files from a previous backup of the suspected-infected systems onto your clean system (you should not do that); (7) are you securing the access to your network (if wireless, are you using WPA2 with a long, unique passphrase, and have you similarly set a good password for its admin access)?\n\nIt's unlikely, but not impossible, that you have malware that has modified the EFI/BIOS in order to reinfect the drive even if the drive has been wiped or replaced. The tools for even starting to analyze this suspicion are all expert-oriented, unfortunately, but research has started in this area and tools *have* been coming out lately. It is theoretically also possible for malware to hide in and reinfect from on-board chips and peripherals, but an attack that sophisticated is not in any commodity crime-ware kit and wouldn't be targeted at an individual. So it's incredibly unlikely but I mention it for completeness.\n\nAlso if you have a network printer, you should probably update its firmware, and update your wireless router's firmware too. If you have other devices on your network that can never really be secured (Samsung or LG Smart TV, refrigerator) consider living without those appliances on the network, or compartmentalizing their access.\n\nEDIT: also, please explain further about this part, with as much detail as possible:\n&gt; This is more than the average malware, even worse than bots alone, Windows is involved. As far as I can tell, no one's broke through the Updates in a year or two?\n&gt; After the constant reinfections right after fixing all these, it crossed my mind that they were the door in.
