Clearly list iocs and dont hide them within text, mark them code. Keep the dialog to a minimim, but be clear when explaining simple things like a hacked wordpress hosting the payload of a macro doc. You dont need to explain a detail unless its significant.

Make it so that I can follow along roughly and replicate your results and conclusions. You'll be less vague that way for those who require all the details.
