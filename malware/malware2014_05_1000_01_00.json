There's literally nothing I could find on this particular software, and google searches just result in a bunch of links that were likely PageRank-manipulated. I tried checking a few sites dedicated to malware removal, and didn't find any hits. Your post here was the first I found.\n\nDo not call that telephone number. They will undoubtedly try to install shit on your PC, and probably try to get your credit card information, etc..\n\nOn my friend's computer, the program appears to have manifested itself as pcreg.exe, or Complete Solution. I just installed it on mine, so I could help out, and it was found under my startup programs as Complete Solution\n\nWhat you'll want to do is hit the Windows Key + R, to launch the Run utility, or use the start menu search function. Type msconfig, and press enter. Once in msconfig, you'll want to switch to the services tab. Click the button that says \"Hide all Microsoft services.\"\n\nThe specific manufacturer accompanying the malicious services are likely going to be listed as unknown. If your infection was similar to my friend's, you'll want to disable anything resembling \"pcreg\" or \"Complete Solution.\" You might as well disable anything that sounds suspicious to you, while you're at it. Check the startup tab in msconfig as well.\n\nAfter restarting the computer, the damn program should be gone. You'll definitely want to run virus/malware/adware scanners. Hitman Pro is a great one for doing an initial scan, as it has a great detection rate and is cloud-based, so it scans very quickly if your internet connection is decent or better. Malwarebytes as someone else suggested is also very good, but will likely take a few hours to run.\n\nI'm going to link a bunch of virus removal utilities, in case someone else stumbles upon this post.\n\n[Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/)\n\n[Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/)\n\n[ESET](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)\n\nIf you or anyone else still has issues after running those three utilities, feel free to PM me.\n\nSystheal removal", "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "removal_reason": null, "author_flair_text": null, "retrieved_utc": 1433740278, "updated_utc": 1668793637, "body_sha1": "7a331eb102ac9012f1c6ad3c15499a9c006abd59", "edited_on": 1399760754, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-05-10 22:08:28"}, {"distinguished": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "created_utc": 1399757572, "id": "chepamr", "archived": true, "gilded": 0, "link_id": "t3_2572d4", "downs": 0, "author": "dumou8343", "parent_id": null, "edited": false, "ups": 2, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "controversiality": 0, "score_hidden": false, "score": 2, "removal_reason": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "That \"prove your a human\" thing is ridiculous... just put in a captcha... also I will PM you I don't seem to be getting the email", "retrieved_utc": 1433739892, "updated_utc": 1668793636, "body_sha1": "d05670245e2c778c7321c90a0230d765b1fc1cec", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-05-10 21:32:52"}, {"parent_id": null, "edited": false, "body": "While the post isn't really relevant, I will still recommend Malwarebytes scan.
