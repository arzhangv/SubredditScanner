It's all about money &amp; business. And it is a bit like a \"Ferrari\" joke  :-)\n\nAV needs malware so they won't kill it but they wanna \"look good\" to get money for \"protection\" licenses. \nMalware needs AV to evade, to gain popularity in criminal-land to get money..to develop more sophisticated malware..evading AV 1,2,3..n, to get more money, and to ride a Ferrari.\n\nAnd honest people are paying either to AV or to malware  that successfully infected them.....or to both!  This is explaining why the malware scheme grew stronger, and AV industry also getting bigger so some of them can buy Ferrari too (so malware or AV people do ride Ferraries)\n\nSo, is this situation fair? For me, this is like we let thief to exist because we want to sell a door-alarm to victim's houses. \n\nHow many AV that actually teaching people to disinfect an infected PC without using the sentence of \"... then install our AV blah Security blah &amp; scan the PC...\" an really show people how to clean an infection in real? \n\nYep, there's no merit in doing it for AV, their Ferrari will gone, so they don't do it. \n\nAnd as result, we have so many defenseless market who don't know what to do in dealing with malware without firing AV product. Yes, AV products gained success to make people becoming dependable to them. OK..It's just \"business\" matter for some of you maybe..\n\nJust some comments from the posted full disclosure..\n\n1. For some countries, owning a collection of malware binaries will be enough for a reason to be raided by police squad. Just FYI.\n\n2. To get the attention form legit entities (AV/Sec/LE/Govt/etc) to get the source codes can be the \"real message\" of that url?\n\n3. Sharing samples or hashes for research purpose should be \"open to all\" since the threat is already out there anyway. \nBut...sharing malware source code, hmm..this shouldn't go \"open to all\".. I mean..who knows who will grab, copy-paste the codes to their new form grabber design, etc. See Power Zeus, or KINS, and now ZeusVM 1.0.1.0 , these are the real example of malware evolves from leaked codes.\nAs far as I know, many individual researchers who introduced them self with solid reference &amp; introduction are getting what they want. I must agree that vetting is indeed necessary, many people hand their important finding to the group with trusting the group will distribute the information to the good hands. \n\n4.
