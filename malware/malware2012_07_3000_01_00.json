{"data": [{"body": "Thank you for the link to this.\n\nHere's a nice TL;DR for people that are interested:\n\n* The EFI boot process on a Mac utilizes a EFI boot file on the internal storage. This can be replaced / patched (known for a long time - rEFIt and rEFInd tools use this).\n* For your Mac to work with a device during EFI boot, it needs a firmware driver. Most are provided by the Mac but some PCIe devices provide their own - which the Mac dynamically loads at boot. This paper shows a successful rewrite/patch of an Apple Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter.\n* The author attempted to patch the internal EFI firmware of the Mac itself but failed - bricking the Mac - because Apple does a cryptographic signature check of the firmware, to prevent third-party / modified EFI firmware.\n* The author makes mention of protecting your Mac with an EFI firmware password, but suggests an attack against it (changing memory modules to reset password) - however, the author does not know that modern Macs manufactured after October 2010 cannot be reset this way and require contacting Apple (I have the internal documentation if you want more details) to unlock: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3554\n\nIn short: For now, this attack only works on harddrives and peripherals (and possibly graphics card - author made mention of a graphics card, but didn't prove it). Wiping the machine and removing adapters = cleaned. In addition, with knowledge and access to the right tools, you could dump the firmware of a \"known good\" identical PCIe/Thunderbolt device and reflash the infected peripheral.\n\nStill, nice article!", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1343662691, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "id": "c5ll0nh", "author_flair_text": null, "downs": 0, "score_hidden": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "parent_id": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "link_id": "t3_xcw6l", "controversiality": 0, "archived": true, "author": "pudquick", "ups": 5, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1429507470, "updated_utc": 1668801161, "body_sha1": "70711ba88edf85d1cfb9966bc17a10858a089f02", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2012-07-30 15:38:11"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 71, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 1, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1343631660000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1343718060000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1343631660000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1343718060000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1674057444.3751245, "api_request_start": 1674101388.985564, "api_request_end": 1674101389.0942183, "api_total_time": 0.10865426063537598}}
