For example, the code may check for a twitter account or domain name that's named based on the md5 hash of the current date, hour, and an extra fixed string. On the account or webhost that the generated name points to, they then relay commands such as setting the drop location, and the commands are signed with a private key so others can't register those resources and send commands to coopt the malware.\n\nThe drop location is typically an irc channel, an ftp server, or a plain old webhost that has a script which drops everything into a file for later collection, or which relays it elsewhere.\n\nThere have been cases where stolen info is relayed through a peer network such that there's no discernible difference between the operator and yet another infected host. This is currently rare, but increasing.\n\nIn cases of more targeted attacks, it's common that the drop location is built into the malware. In these cases sometimes it's usually ftp, mail or a web host. But sometimes more devious methods are used in order to bypass firewalls. For example, the malware can perform dns lookups where the query is actually passing the information. Usually encryption would be used, but a simple example would be querying the nameserver ns.example.com for (creditcardnumber).(firstname).(lastname).(csc).example.com. A garbage address comes back, but something intercepting the requests now has a name, card number, and card security code (cvv2/ccid/cvc2/we) even if all external traffic was prohibited on the compromised host, but requests can still be relayed through an internal nameserver.", "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "score_hidden": false, "edited": false, "retrieved_utc": 1427721351, "updated_utc": 1668792086, "body_sha1": "de417aecb7215c042f28eb19beaa376f84b65b2f", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-03-12 16:22:22"}, {"link_id": "t3_2ysyta", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": false, "id": "cpcmwzv", "parent_id": null, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1426176067, "downs": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "score": -7, "ups": -7, "author": "lnsecurity", "body": "Malware usually sends stolen information to an FTP server or an SMTP server to stored/mailed out to the attacker, and in some cases through TCP/IP.
