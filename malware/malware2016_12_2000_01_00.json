I suspect (and actually know, in a couple of cases) that there are others on this sub who will be in a similar boat.\n\nI work as an incident response consultant, and part of my job is (sometimes) analyzing suspicious binary files from customers, to determine what they are. So, for malware the question they ask is typically: is it malicious, and if it is what can it do? Does it contain characteristics that indicate that it was tailored to and targeted at my client? Can it be used to exfiltrate data from our network? Did it do that? And so on.\n\nWhere possible I try to take advantage of an automated sandbox to perform initial sample analysis work, as it can save me a lot of time (personally I'm a fan of the Cuckoo-Modified/Spender Sandbox fork of Cuckoo). Sandboxes are not 100% reliable of course but it's the easiest starting point. I will not send any data to any other third party such as an AV company without the explicit permission of my client. Typically when we do work with a third party, it's going to be something like submitting samples to their AV vendor via their support contract, so that the AV vendor can get new signatures pushed out and our client can scan their environment. \n\nI may also need to put together things like Yara signature sets or other IOCs for the client to use with their existing security controls (EDR solutions like Carbon Black, their SIEM, etc.) to help them search their environment for other affected systems. \n\nRegarding Programming, nothing is a bad option (although a few languages probably have less value). I'm awful at it personally. Being able to interpret basic Visual Basic is helpful for malicious documents, same for Javascript too. C and Assembly are cornerstone facets of binary analysis and reverse engineering. Python is awesome for developing your own tools, and is what a lot of tools available on GitHub are being written in.\n\nI like to follow a lot of people on Twitter who are much much better at the malware analysis thing than I am as well. If you start sifting through the #malware and #dfir hashtags (and probably some others I'm forgetting), you'll start to identify a lot of folks who post good stuff like tools and analysis writeups.\n\n----\n\nRegarding your question about tools you posted in a reply to SMOKE_LIKE_RIBBONS:\n\nGrab the [Remnux](https://remnux.org/) virtual appliance, which comes with a large collection of analysis tools. There is a lot of documentation on the site as well that discusses what all is actually present. \n\nIt's not a one-stop shop, as there are a lot of useful tools that are for Windows (ollydbg or x64dbg, if you get into debugging binaries, simple stuff like Regshot and Process Monitor... also more personal preference-dependent stuff like PE Studio).\n\nDeveloping a comprehensive list of tools is pretty tough, as ultimately you need to determine what it is that you want to do yourself. Reversing and performing dynamic code and behavioral analysis by running samples is pretty different from doing some basic static analysis. There's a ton of personal preference involved as well, as there are lots of tools that all do the same basic things.\n\nIsolating your analysis system from your home network is also a good idea.
