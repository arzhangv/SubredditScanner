They've got little to no say in anything, it's just given to them to both placate and make them feel important.\n\nBut the fixing part?  That's what's funny, fixing it or not doesn't really cost more money in the short-term, it's the long-term where it does cost money.  Fixing some of these issues is literally as easy as writing a one-liner in bash and hitting Enter and letting it do its thing across our farm.  Case in point: we have two compromises that have affected similar numbers of clients and both have occurred at roughly the same time.  One is actually being resolved through an automated reset, the other is not though its solution is the exact same as the former: an automated reset (the tool we use to reset both is _the same tool_, the difference is one modifier).  The decision to do one while ignoring the other is that the latter \"creates more work\" though the former somehow doesn't, despite both can be done the exact same way.  If I manually reset each of these types of accounts, the difference in time spent doing each one is measured in milliseconds only due to typing (I can reduce this through macros).  If it's automated, they take the exact same amount of time to execute.\n\nYet, in their minds (having never actually done these), one takes longer than the other and creates more problems despite the evidence to the contrary (with graphs and numbers!).  The last time we actually did this same thing, it created about 1% more work and was hailed as a success.", "score": 2, "retrieved_utc": 1433225376, "updated_utc": 1668792676, "body_sha1": "9c32f80ace07424add482ba52cd72278753f257d", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-04-05 21:58:57"}, {"archived": true, "body": "Nope, Cuckoo is what I'm looking for.
