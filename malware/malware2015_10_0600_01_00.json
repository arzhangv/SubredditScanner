Once you find new malware, nobody has seen it before (including heurs) so you create a new malware name. You couldn't possibly still protect your customers without showing them a trendy new name? So without a name, no sig push...\n\nPlaceholders would work just fine for this. If there was an authorized org to create names NOT based on malware characteristics, just a name, and if everyone used this format like Msft does, there would be improvement. \n\nSo McAfee discovers a world-new worm, after analysis they sig it and need a name. So they use an allocation of identifiers that are mapped to names the name org will later generate and assign. For example, Temp: Win32/abce18582.PatientZero would later be named WORM: Win32/FruitScoop.001\n\nThen the org somehow decides on a name and maps it to the temp sig name above, accessible publicy, API etc. Then all the Avs can see the new revision and change their temp sig names to the more officially named one. And later down the road something changes, because everyone is already synced up, name mapping is a breeze, no different than updating a domain whois or NS registry. \n\nBecause lets be honest, the name is arbitrary, who gives a shit. Bladablindy, gopher whatever! But is my computer protected from the nasty worms out there? I don't care what its called. That's what customers want. \n\nSo this way you can create the sig, push out critical fixes without needing to actually identify or classify the threat, just block it whichever way works. Then once we all decide what the threat was by studying, analyzing and classifying it, a name is given and done. Win for everyone. \n\nMaybe im crazy, but nobody can disagree that traditional AV aka current day AV needs to change fast, regardless of \"signature\" naming conventions.

You never know who's going to get the newest malware sample, metadata or other intelligence that allows you to protect all of your customers, so information like that is shared through trust relationships.  Information sharing is so important to our industry that there's even an [Industry Connections Security Group](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/indconn/icsg/index.html) under the [IEEE Standards Association](http://standards.ieee.org/) to help build tools and frameworks to allow for information interchange.  If you're not familiar with it, the IEEE-SA is an international, non-profit organization that serves as a body for various technical standards, including focusingrather heavily on the research and collaboration side of things.  That ensures that everyone reaps the benefits.  Some of the standards you may have used but not been aware of include Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), used by millions (if not billions) of devices around the globe, as well as older ones like FireWire (IEEE-1394) and parallel printer (IEEE-1284) interfaces.\n\nI've been on the road for the past week-and-a-half, having attended two conferences where security folks share information with each other (not everything can be done via conference calls, I'm afraid), the third starts in a couple of days, after which I can get home, figure out who's going to collaborate on what, and other exciting stuff like doing laundry and expense reports.\n\nNo security company, or, at least, no anti-malware company, exists in a vacuum.  Security is a bigger problem than any one company (or government) can take on, no matter how big they are, and that means everyone shares the workload.  The whole concept of \"[today you, tomorrow me](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elal2/have_you_ever_picked_up_a_hitchhiker/c18z0z2)\" pretty much describes the anti-malware space to a T.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n\nP.S.  There is a basic fallacy in the whole \"grand unified sample naming theory\" that I didn't explicitly get into, since I had intended to steer the conversation in that direction.  However, given your comment about \"standard naming conventions,\" let's see if you can figure the reason it won't work.  I will give you a hint:  *It's about time.*  \n\nP.P.S.
