But the fact is that it always comes down to a value comparison. Your \"we will not negotiate\" platitudes are all well and good until you realize there are tens of thousands of people who have years or decades worth of important, personal, valuable data that could be wiped away in an instant. People who are too computer illiterate to backup or know what backups are. They want their data back much more than they want to contribute to a global effort to starve the criminals.\n\nOf course, if you have relatively recent backup or really do not care about the data, you shouldn't pay the ransom.\n\nWhat needs to happen is greater cooperation between the FBI and Russian and Ukrainian law enforcement (which sadly is very unlikely given the political climate), and more effort spent security industry professionals and researchers. Law enforcement and private security companies did an excellent (albeit slow) job taking out the original Cryptolocker and compromising their infrastructure to distribute the private keys. Similar efforts are being made against all the other variants. \n\nThese adversaries and threats will *always* exist, just like real-life robberies.
