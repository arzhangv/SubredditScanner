While I don't doubt that Russia had people probing and potentially even gaining access, that doesn't mean that they were involved in the leaks.  It's possible, but with the rise of insider threats, the insecurity in the majority of networks, and incompetence of end users, there are a ton of ways those documents could have been accessed.  It's not even mutually exclusive - it's entirely possible that what Crowdstrike claims is proof of Russian access is true, but that doesn't mean that there wasn't a leaker either.  And those possibilities are before even bringing up repurposed malware.\n\nIronically, if they continue to operate in the same way I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about the CIA hitting US businesses (etc) due to Vault 7.\n\nIn any case, sadly, most people aren't willing to hear any of this.  It goes back to the politics.

APTs aren't the only ones putting out false information; domestic groups are regularly putting out false news stories as well as the general shoddy clickbait style article.  Making getting accurate information even worse, organizations typically rely in circular reporting.  [Crowdstrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/) points to \"independent articles\" which have been published since they released their findings as supporting information, which in turn point to crowdstrikes initial findings.  \n\nDespite this, everyone talking about attribution typically just has a \"just trust us\" type of attitude - which in an environment where nearly everything is politicized and has an agenda behind it is mindblowing.\n\nI'm not in a position to make a claim one way or the other on the matter personally, but it seems like articles like that one make a lot of leaps.  In all honesty, given the fact that Bloomberg endorsed HRC, Crowdstrike is run by this [\"Cyber\" guy](http://www.joshwieder.net/2015/08/crowdstrike-founder-george-kurtz-made.html)... hell I'd probably be more likely to take Ankit Fadia's input at face value.\n\nWhat I find funny personally though, is we've got senate reports on how \n&gt; \"the more polarized a society, the more vulnerable it is\u2014America in 2016 was highly polarized, with myriad cracks and fissures to drive wedges into. Not old wedges, but improved high-tech wedges that allowed Moscow\u2019s operators to attack their target faster, more reactively, and at far larger scale than ever before.\"  \n\nYet, here people are still trying to argue publicly on who's responsible. Ultimately the attribution doesn't even matter at this point when we're helping the Russian agenda with the petty infighting.
