By the way I sincerely appreciate your helpful comments. This is pretty much how much of these threats have gone this past week one or two people are actually using their brain and everyone else is saying that I am paranoid. Anyway yeah it's been 15 years since I had any kind of computer virus it's been 15 years since I have ever thought I have had any kind of malware or infection so this is not some kind of Affliction that I have that I like to poke around and make things up that I'm infected or something. Anyway yeah my current belief is that maybe this is some new sophisticated attack that is based on quantity. They infect as many people as possible and then it just lays dormant until they get some kind of telemetry that there is something worth stealing. Which is why this doesn't do any pop ups or anything obvious it just sits there running in the background sending messages home every now and then. Anyway I'm going to continue on my search. Think about this if you had some kind of malware that was top-notch and extremely hard to eradicate and most people have never seen it. What do you think a forum post would look like? It would look just like this everyone saying there is nothing there and that I'm being too paranoid.", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1517380444, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dtib0yl", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_7u0frz", "parent_id": 30079878472, "permalink": "/r/Malware/comments/7u0frz/a_warning/dtib0yl/", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "subreddit_type": "public", "retrieved_utc": 1518452872, "updated_utc": 1668768499, "body_sha1": "6949b7333952f4f4b73496e24679dc6f4e5803be", "utc_datetime_str": "2018-01-31 06:34:04"}, {"author": "ZugNachPankow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "I'm more inclined to believe this was a quick-and-dirty fix by someone without much experience as a sysadmin, which was never developed into an actual fix because \"hey, it works already!\".", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1517357818, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dthr6vj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7trdna", "parent_id": null, "permalink": "/r/Malware/comments/7trdna/twitter_thread_congressmans_web_site_may_have/dthr6vj/", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "subreddit_type": "public", "retrieved_utc": 1518442941, "updated_utc": 1668768459, "body_sha1": "4271a7399bdf661fe2b02fa01e026ac30252ca18", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2018-01-31 00:16:58"}, {"author": "v4lt5u", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Im reading through and most of your proof are just misconseptions.
