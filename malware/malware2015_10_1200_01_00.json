The same with your absurd argument that if what was described in the Reuters article was impossible that Kaspersky would fail to point that out.  To be honest, I think you misread the Reuters article, because what you describe is impossible, it's also not the attack described in the article.  I called colleagues at two major AV firms, who concurred, so I'm pretty sure you misunderstand the article.  It's certainly light on technical detail which could lead to the confusion.  The impossibility in the scenario you describe comes from a number of constraints you place that are not present in the article.  Nowhere does it say the attack was limited to particular AV vendors, and only those AV vendors.  Honestly, you just pissed me off, because you're pretty much the worst behaved person I've ever seen on the internet, which is saying something.  You came right out the gate with insults in your first response, and I'm sad for you, because you're THAT infosec guy.
