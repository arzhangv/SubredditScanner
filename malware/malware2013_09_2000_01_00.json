The reason you were given doesn't make sense either. \n\n&gt;\"A/V will not detect hacked accounts and attack scripts\".\n\nOk, then how does wiping it and installing their anti-virus software mitigate the problem if it won't detect it in the first place? They aren't being very specific here and might just be doing a poor job explaining themselves. Though if they give you this sort of answer it means they likely have difficulty explaining the policy in the first place to users which reflects the policy itself. \n\nIn the end, there is likely nothing you can do about it.
