The material is EXACTLY the kind of thing I was looking for as an intermediate level reverse engineer.  Most of the trainings I've taken end up teaching assembly fundamentals and how to triage malware by looking at strings, imports, exports, and function calls.  This is where the current offering of SANS RE courses stops.\n\nThis course goes to the next step and focuses on what to look for and do when you as a reverse engineer have to actually reverse a sample (rather than just triage).  The concepts this course covers the areas that'll put an intermediate RE into a rut.  So far the course focuses on static analysis, which is fantastic because I really can't point to any other material out there that covers the same topics from an RE lens.  The price point is a real steal.  If you're comfortable with the material in Practical Malware Analysis and Practical Reverse Engineering, this course seems like a very solid next step.\n\nTo prove I'm not a shill, my main complaint so far is that the course is very hands off on exercises (which personally, I find understandable since it's relatively new).  What I mean by that is there is often a gap between the videos/readings and what you should be doing with the samples provided.  You have to just kind of piece together \"Oh, this lesson was on X, I should go look for X in the samples\" rather than a one-to-one walk through of the samples.  Some of the readings and videos reference \"other material\" and it seems like the weeks were released in a different order than they were initially written.  All that considered, this course is EASILY worth the cost.  Kudos to the creators for providing much needed material for folks at the intermediate level.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1611010788, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "gjrozwe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_k2t4or", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": 35672897019, "permalink": "/r/Malware/comments/k2t4or/opinions_on_zero2automated_malware_course/gjrozwe/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Malware", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "retrieved_utc": 1621454535, "updated_utc": 1668694706, "body_sha1": "9b219d8dc65566708fabc365289459f8c4c5cc92", "utc_datetime_str": "2021-01-18 22:59:48"}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "body": "It looks like you are posting a question, possibly looking for technical support. \n\nThis subreddit\u2019s purpose is to discuss malware internals and technical details. *This is NOT a place for help with malware removal or various other end-user questions.
