The machoviz tool is a powerful mach-o binary analysis and visualization tool designed to provide quick analysis of apple's ios and mac binaries. Originally the tool was designed to help teach people how mach-o files are laid out visually, however, since inception it's grown into a powerful analysis tool as well. Using a browser you can quickly upload and process mach-o files to display function graphs, full string recovery, xrefs, objective c, hex views and color coded disassembly. For more information about this tool and all its features we invite you to review the whitepaper at the link below. Additionally quick start instructions are available on the machoviz front page. Anrc proudly presented this tool at defcon21. It's free to use as software as a service. We hope that it lends itself well to the reversing and network defense communities. Please let us know how well it works for you! We're constantly improving it and value any feedback you have for us.", "id": "cbi3gp7", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "link_id": "t3_1jtf0j", "ups": 1, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": null, "created_utc": 1375803956, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "score": 1, "subreddit": "Malware", "edited": false, "archived": true, "retrieved_utc": 1429926119, "updated_utc": 1668793378, "body_sha1": "d369f80345d1abed7b96852092836a369073dfa4", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2013-08-06 15:45:56"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 60, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 1, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1375772460000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1375858860000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1375772460000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1375858860000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673945683.810305, "api_request_start": 1674102030.5959816, "api_request_end": 1674102030.6891482, "api_total_time": 0.09316658973693848}}
