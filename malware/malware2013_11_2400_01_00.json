Maybe more of an explanation of what you will be using these systems for will help.\n\nThe reason I use truecrypt is that I used to use windows passwords, but then I realized that those don't actually do much so I switched to a way of passwording my computer that actually works. I am going to use truecrypt regardless of malware concerns, I was also going to use linux for some things regardless of malware concerns. I had the realization the system I was going to use anyway might have an incidental benefit in stopping the propagation of malware. So this setup isn't entirely contrived to stop malware.\n\nThat being said one particular concern is having cryptocurrency private keys stolen. I would like a system that I trust enough to play around with private keys of cryptocurrenies. Further, I don't access banking websites and other financial logins very often, and it's really not that much trouble to boot to a different hard drive when I need to do something like that. I have had a scare in the past with identity theft, and I would rather just do my taxes, online banking and other things where sensitive information is being transmitted on a more trusted system, while still being able to use my normal windows system without being super vigilant about which pdfs I open or which websites I visit. You don't need to be a criminal or a malware researcher to be curious about what you need to do to comfortably deal with sensitive information on a computer while also not having to be constantly worried about security during normal use. My thought was that what I described would give me the best of both worlds, so I can be care free(and click on random links and executables if I feel like it) when booted from one drive, and feel secure when booted from the other. This seems like a lot of work and thought over relatively mundane concerns, but if I can eliminate small bits of future stress accumulated over years I think it's worth it.\n\n&gt;As for cross-platform malware, I have not really seen it used in the wild, but only through whitepapers and maybe the one-off POC (proof of concept) the risk of code being able to change to suit different operating systems is not really (in my opinion) a plausible reality, especially when it is Windows -&gt; Linux. Possible Mac -&gt; linux/unix, but again, not in the wild at the moment and not likely to be.\n\nThanks, it's good to know that this is rare/unknown in the wild.\n", "author": "moneygames", "parent_id": 26944849550, "link_id": "t3_1rdwxr", "retrieved_utc": 1428520054, "updated_utc": 1668791395, "body_sha1": "7d66b7eedca1ccddd35b7793b63e64994f68b9ad", "edited_on": 1385348180, "utc_datetime_str": "2013-11-25 02:41:12"}, {"parent_id": 26944850800, "link_id": "t3_1rdwxr", "author": "moneygames", "score": 1, "body": "The ultimate goal of my post is to seek general information about varieties of propagation methods used by malware.
