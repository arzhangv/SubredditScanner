The NSA can use these PRISM requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the internet backbone, to focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier, and to get data that is easier to handle, among other things.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Malware/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1510271163, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "dpli0k1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7bwhc1", "parent_id": 29845937033, "permalink": "/r/Malware/comments/7bwhc1/what_is_the_longest_stayed_hidden_worm_trojan_or/dpli0k1/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "subreddit_type": "public", "retrieved_utc": 1512479713, "updated_utc": 1668766811, "body_sha1": "4230250a74a3aaab1ac64ab48b5db89974b50a44", "utc_datetime_str": "2017-11-09 23:46:03"}, {"author": "DrinkMoreCodeMore", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "The NSA directly taps the cables under the sea to log all of the data, so yes, it's 100% fact they are logging and listening to all overseas telco and internet communications.\n\nBut tl;dr -

That's when I first noticed that a certain trigger was acquiring a mobile data connection: the AFWall+ log was quiet, and the traffic I saw via packet captures was just connections to google and NTP servers (I assume normal built-in OS functions), until I allowed the phone to get cell service.
