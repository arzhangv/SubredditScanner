[Brian Krebs puts email-based malware detection under 30%](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/06/a-closer-look-recent-email-based-malware-attacks/)  Pick one of the name brand AV shops and go with it (or Microsoft Security Essentials, for that matter, though they place low on the list).  \n\nWhile antivirus is used to detect, you can also lower chances of infection by taking the 'protect' approach.  Most malware exploits existing software vulnerabilities, so doing the following will help reduce your risk profile substantially:\n* patch all software using legitimate sources (i.e. download Adobe Flash patches from Adobe.com) as soon as possible.  This includes Microsoft's monthly updates.\n* Remove or severely limit usage of Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, or Oracle Java.  If you do not have a business need to run it, remove it, or dual-browse (use the browser-plugins for these apps in IE while doing all of your web browsing in Firefox/Chrome, and switch over to IE with the plugins when you run into business content you need to render with one of those plugins).\n* do not use pirated software.  Many malwares, bad.  \n* use caution when opening email attachments.  Phishing has come a long way in the last 5 years and looks completely legitimate.  If you're not expecting an attachment from Bob yet you receive one, call him and ask him if he sent it.\n* Consider using a DNS intelligence service such as OpenDNS to monitor/filter the sites you and your household/small business use.  OpenDNS can filter out known malware domains (as well as other unsavory content), and can provide a report showing some behavioral results of the users of your environment so you have some idea if you've got a host that has contracted a known infection.\n\nThose should help keep you safer than simple AV alone.
