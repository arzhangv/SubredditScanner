The fact that MBAR has been able to remove several rootkits from current AV software was very impressive to me. I respect MB and their excellent software. \n\nYes a lot of crypters/botnets do advertise the ability but it's mainly just marketing. A lot of them aren't FUD either, they might be for a few hours or at most a couple days. The more features you pack into a crypter/botnet, the bigger the file becomes and the more chances of the file corrupting with poor execution rates. \n\nSome botnet files are 300-400kB which is considerably large if you want to use it with an exploit pack. Under 100kB or 50kB is optimal. A crypter stub can also affect the actual botnet infection file. Good crypter stubs are usually around 10-30kB which adds onto the size of the original botnet file. Some also offer compression like UPX. \n\nThose crypters are clearnet are often bloated with features, huge stub files around 100kB and can often corrupt stubs. They are also mainly made with .NET dependencies which can have issues if used with a C++ botnet file. I've seen it all, some advertise botkillers, disable AV's, change icons, signature information, installation path, persistence, even built in rootkits into the crypters. That's just too many features and can end up drastically lowering the execution rate of the ultimate file, completely corrupting the file and rendering it useless, or break some core features of the botnet. \n\nThat's why big time botnet owners will use manual crypts. Significantly smaller stubs and are manually done to ensure maximum compatibility and that it doesn't corrupt. \n\nI have had some instances where MBAM couldn't remove some malware for some reason. I ran the scanner on a heavily infected PC as well as MBAR. It removed a few hundred malware/PUPs. I rebooted the PC and followed their instructions. I scanned it again and it found 6-7, I cleaned it again and rebooted. Scanned again but those 6-7 were still there, the same files. This was a few years ago so things could have changed by now.

I've checked out a few crypters on a couple of forums, and a lot of them advertise this capability.  But don't most antivirus suites offer self-protection features?  I've heard that Malware bytes offers a suite called \"Chameleon\" that prevents malware from disabling it.  How does that work, and how effective is it?  I'd assume it would use some kind of API hooking or DLL injection, similarly to FUD malware, ironically...\n\nA lot of AV software also requires a password to modify/stop it as well, although I'd assume that's only effective against malware directly opening the application and deleting/stopping it, and not against more 'advanced' methods like killing the process or damaging the registry entry.\n\nSo if a computer has something like Malwarebytes chameleon, would it be difficult for malware to disable the OS?  Could I count on something like Malwarebytes Chameleon to protect a heavily infected OS, or is that just marketing hype?\n\nEdit: I just checked out the Malwarebytes Chameleon webpage, and the description didn't inspire much confidence -- apparently Chameleon is just a series of scripts named after important Windows processes (I suppose to fool simple malware) that just downloads the main Malwarebytes AV -- it doesn't clean anything itself.  The article I read said that Chameleon could be stopped simply by looking past the given names of the application (ieexplorer, svchost, etc) to find their actual identities, or just by looking at the file sizes, noticing the discrepancy between the file sizes of the Chameleon files and the actual ieexplore/svchost file sizes, and using that to tell the difference.  And since Chameleon doesn't actually scan anything, but just installs vanilla Malwarebytes, you wouldn't even need to stop it -- just stop the Malwarebytes AV it downloads.\n\nLike I said, this doesn't really inspire confidence that 'protected' AV software will actually keep me safe...\n\nEdit2: Another article I read said that a lot of AV suites make use of ASLR and DEP to protect themselves, in varying degrees (some AV only use ASLR for ~20% of their codebase, whereas others use it for 100%).  But how would that protect the AV?  I don't see how that would prevent malware from damaging the registry entry or killing the AV process...", "retrieved_utc": 1437217538, "updated_utc": 1668795655, "body_sha1": "145c8c7cb6b7e36503aca51ead88c3f0932fca51", "edited_on": 1434826585, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-06-20 18:26:15"}, {"created_utc": 1434821571, "id": "csd1djp", "link_id": "t3_3ag384", "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 27835483456, "controversiality": 0, "body": "They do, but they only look for certain things.

Note that they use private AV scanners, similar to VirusTotal. Problem with VirustTotal is they distribute samples to AV companies, it's listed in their ToS.\n\nWhen they say \"runtime FUD\" it's mostly just the execution of the bot, the hooking, the installing itself into the computer part. Scantime FUD just bypasses the signature based detection that AV uses. \n\nHowever, when the malware is a botnet and it starts commanding that your computer starts sending thousands of packets to a website to attack it, this obviously triggers the AV to take notice. It can trace the process and remove it. \n\nPolymorphic tries to counteract this by constantly changing the code so it can never quite remove it. And sometimes, the hooks are deep enough and removing it could cause the system to corrupt, this is especially true with rootkits. And of course with a lot of botnets these days that can disable AV software, your AV won't even know. \n\n20,000 is like the magical limi for full feature botnets. One of them is bound to detect the malware with heuristic analysis if the botnet is sending commands like DDoS. The AV's take note, distribute the samples and analysis to other AV's and your file will be detected quickly. \n\nSo people made a form of botnets called \"loaders.\" They're still botnet but limited in the features, their primary function to the load other malware onto the computers, hence the term loader. These files are usually smaller of size to allow for maximum execution rate, have low profiles, are very stable on the software level and can potentially infect hundreds of thousands of computers. They are limited in functions though, no fancy features like denial of service, host editing, password stealing, or any major functions that can trigger an AV. \n\nThe most well known and sold loader is probably Andromeda. Andromeda's basic function is the ability to infect computers, install other files on it (EXE/DLL), update the bot, or kill the bot (remove malware from computer). I think the price of Andromeda was around $800 the last time I checked, it was a year ago so that could be different. \n\nThe seller also made modules which are like plugins to add functions to the bot. Three modules were available, form grabber, rootkit and and reverse socks4 plugin. The formgrabber captured passwords live as they were entered into websites. Ring 3 rootkit to make sure the malware stays on the bot, and socks4 to use the bots as a proxy.\n\nBest way to protect yourself from malware is commonsense. Don't download fishy files from the internet. Most malware is made for Windows yes. So your chances are low but not impossible. I did see a RAT before made with Java that worked on Windows, Mac and Linux. But it's a RAT and it's not likely to be distributed on a large scale, they would be more targeted infection vectors.\n\nThere are potential exploits for Linux that are more common because it's open source. A majority of webservers are ran on Linux and there's a large array of exploits available such as RFI/LFI. They could also gain access to the server through exploits on the software it is running. A recent example of this is a WordPress plugin - Revolution Slider. It was an LFI exploit that could download the wp-config file and gain access to the database. The authors didn't announce this, the only reason it was found because it was on an underground forum and because it's so popular.
