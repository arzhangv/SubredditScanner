I felt when helping review the paper (I am not the author) that it was free of any kind of marketing bias.\n\nCan I ask what you found objectionable and would like to have seen removed or re-stated? Just so you are aware, my motive (besides getting the feedback) is somewhat self-interest:  I am going to have a paper of my own out soon, and would like to avoid anything which could cause it to be confused with marketing collateral.  No offense to the folks who do that, but I expect our research to stand on its own.\n\nThanks again for your honesty and openness.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky ", "parent_id": 27546257297, "subreddit": "Malware", "controversiality": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1424847026, "updated_utc": 1668779252, "body_sha1": "a245495585cd5ae75f11b6dc8072dd7947272af2", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-16 07:46:36"}, {"downs": 0, "link_id": "t3_2skuq0", "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "archived": false, "body": "Have you tried checking your startup and scheduled tasks using ccleaner?

However, I have rarely in over 10 years found somthing this illusive, I see it as a challenge I can learn from from a subjective view, also with the giant rise in these types of malware (if it is that) in the last year, and with obvious guns pointed at javascript, and BHO injectors that are becoming fileless and more illusive, I simply wish to find acertainment, that this problem is not caused by fileless malware. I am also aware that if it is a new type of illusive malware that it can take time for companies to update the definitions to accomodate new threats. Absolute solution is only a secondary objective or I would have done what you stated and wiped and reloaded a while ago. I see these types of situations as a means of brushing up on my skills, and learning how to apply them in fastly darkening age for malware prevention and removal. I simply am looking for assistance in acertaining the circumstances of this proxy and the machinations in which it populates the registry. I think we all need to be doing similar activities, we rely on automated procceses far too much from what I have seen, and the way I see malware evolving in the future, it will be difficult to rely on tools that are updates a little bit slowly for my tastes untill the ends justify the means of hiring more coders and analysts beyond the norm.\n\n", "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": 27556522364, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1424851414, "updated_utc": 1668779241, "body_sha1": "128fd63d01622ee5b31785d2338b3396e21b5d26", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-16 02:12:21"}, {"ups": 2, "created_utc": 1421374326, "edited": false, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_2skuq0", "id": "cnqgrdr", "downs": 0, "archived": false, "author": "bbarnes2112", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "controversiality": 0, "distinguished": null, "body": "the HMP I refered to in the OP was an acronym for hitmanpro.  it was able to detect and remove the proxy, however upon restart, repopulates again. sorry for the lack of clarification", "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "score": 2, "gilded": 0, "parent_id": 27556540542, "score_hidden": false, "retrieved_utc": 1424851418, "updated_utc": 1668779241, "body_sha1": "bfd655c723bfb377c1a4814494b43836990b6e01", "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-16 02:12:06"}, {"downs": 0, "id": "cnqgigh", "archived": false, "author": "[deleted]", "link_id": "t3_2skuq0", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "created_utc": 1421373864, "ups": 1, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "parent_id": null, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "body": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1424851534, "updated_utc": 1668779241, "body_sha1": "228f7d207920fb84335fac5b2b06ed7b472ece9e", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-16 02:04:24"}, {"edited": false, "ups": 1, "created_utc": 1421373468, "author": "gkal70", "id": "cnqgari", "downs": 0, "archived": false, "link_id": "t3_2skuq0", "author_flair_text": null, "body": "ran across this exact same thing at work today, i'm at a loss as well. i tried manually removing pum.proxy and loopback from the registy, still no luck.  the one program i tired that you didnt mention was hitman pro. it said it fixed the proxy settings but its results were similar to what you had with rougekiller", "distinguished": null, "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "score": 1, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1424851633, "updated_utc": 1668779241, "body_sha1": "6fcd0b9d7aee7939019e52a5b2c3bad5a5c9e4f0", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2015-01-16 01:57:48"}, {"downs": 0, "archived": false, "id": "cnqfwqk", "author": "JusLykeAspen", "link_id": "t3_2skuq0", "author_flair_text": null, "edited": false, "ups": 5, "created_utc": 1421372746, "score": 5, "parent_id": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Malware", "author_flair_css_class": null, "distinguished": null, "body": "Flatten and re-install.
