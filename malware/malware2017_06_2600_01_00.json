Honestly I'm not TERRIBLY surprised that someone used NPM for such purposes but I almost never see it done in the wild.  Especially the MD5 hashed package name, like the domain in my case, that's such a simple trick that works very well.\n\nTracking these schemes down and digging into the code has always been one of my greatest fascinations, and lately I've not had many opportunities (because my day job is no longer infosec, instead I'm just a lowly developer) so when the Infinity New Tab one happened to me, I just had to scratch that itch and go digging.\n\nThe chrome-web-store js stuff does indeed look like it could be disabling uninstalls from somewhere, but I reckon its from just the chrome webstore page, but there are thankfully a few more ways to uninstall an extension as well so I think it's not as bad as it could be.\n\nOften times we think to ourselves this sort of investigation can't really be of any benefit, but important discoveries are often made due to someone somewhere deciding to investigate why and how.  Sometimes the importance of those discoveries aren't realised for decades, even.  This is certainly true in science, where one can find many cases where an incredible discovery or theory was made based on information in a long forgotten paper from decades prior.  It's unlikely that two people on reddit posting their findings about chrome extension malware will ever lead humanity towards a theory of the universe, but I'm sure one day it might be of some importance to some future researcher looking into a bigger, more damaging malware attack and find what we've learned useful in some way to them.\n\nGreat job!
