'Low hanging fruit'.\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't bother with creating an image. It's too much work. Ransacking a system, its more appropriate to have a list of filetypes to search for prior, as well as key directories to inspect right off the bat where potentially sensitive information could be stored.\n\nYou could easily write a script that could do all of this for you fairly quickly.\n\nIn my experience, network shares are pretty vulnerable and focusing on those might actually fly under the radar. Many places will leave them wide open which is just insane. Appropriate for say a public share but, putting the everyone group on say like the finance share...just wow.\n\nSay you find a file server for a large enterprise network, you have admin creds somehow. Check for backup scripts. If one exists create a duplicate backup script but edit it, target only the data you want and have it set to execute after the normal script is finished. \n\nMost places routinely check backups but, its not an everyday thing. Let the script do its thing over 48hrs. You could even name the script something that looks semi legitimate like 'microsoft whatever'.\n\nWhat I just describe is easy as pie and could be running in the background while the system is being used. If you had machines on the network you wanted to target if permissions were elevated enough, you could be making routine backups of a targets important folders onto the file server daily.\n\nI've done this sort of thing before for legitimate reasons. If I was targeting somebody, I would do everything a system admin would consider normal. Blend in with the backup environment and thats pretty damn good coverage imo. \n\nHell you could have that script upload everything to some cloud storage account and delete the local files after it wraps everything up.
