After loading, manually put a breakpoint on the exported `qwerty` function and run.\n2. Debug `rundll32` with IDA, which is much nicer\n    - Run `rundll32`, pause at OEP\n    - Go to `Debugger` -&gt; `Debugger options` -&gt; set a conditional breakpoint on loaded modules\n    - Condition: [`strstr(GetEventModuleName(), \"trust_me_imma_dolphin.dll\") != -1`](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1214.shtml)\n\nWhat are you interested in, specifically? Locky is written in C++, and so static analysis might be a bit difficult.\n\nConverting the DLL to an EXE is probably not a great idea (not terrible, but not too practical), and much less is running malware with WINE on Linux.
