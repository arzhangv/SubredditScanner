If you didn't change the default password on the router or if you left it printed on something some where where that person could have access to it (like that sticker on some of the Verizon routers, thanks Verizon!), then they could simply log into your router and disable your firewall through the admin web configuration interface.  Alternatively, if they have access to the router physically, they could just do a hard reset on the configuration settings of the router to reset the admin access account password to gain access into the router by looking up the default admin password for that model router and change the configuration.  This would allow an external attacker to penetrate your network easily and gain access to any device connected to your local LAN from the WAN.\n\nAlternative theory, because the person was allowed access to your home network directly on a local level and assuming they have some basic skills to run scripts locally on your network from their own device connected to your network (or introduce those scripts at a physically accessible computer on your local network), they don't need to drop your firewall they could just start openly looking for vulnerabilities/exploits in the devices on your local network like your phone or even the router itself and take advantage of those to do whatever it is that petty criminals do.\n\nSome things to note, if your phone was using WIFI for connectivity and your \"visitor\" reset the configuration on the router or did anything to disrupt the operation of the WIFI AP such as through a reboot of the router as would happen after a hard reset, your phone might behave a little funny as it switches over from WIFI to Cell Network for connectivity (assuming you have this setting in your phone setup to switch between WIFI or Cell Network on its own based on detected connectivity).\n\nIt's highly unlikely that your phone has been compromised.  With a non-rooted/non-jailbroken phone that you regularly keep updated, it would take an extremely skilled and targeted attacker to know exactly which vulnerability/vulnerabilities and also they would realistically need physical access to your phone to compromise it for anything useful.  The only realistic way they could remotely access your phone is if you left your Bluetooth on and for whatever reason allowed for any device to pair to it automatically without any PIN or approval from you.  \n\nExamples of more advanced methods would include very directed and targeted attacks.  With full access to your router, the attacker could reconfigure your router's DNS server to hijack all DNS resolutions on your local network to point to a custom webpage loaded with scripts that can target specific vulnerabilities in the o/s (provided they know the exact version/revision), browser or other apps, etc. on your phone so that when you use it to connect to some webpage it brings you either silently without your knowledge or openly to their custom page to infect/access your phone to steal information from it or load applications on to it etc.  This requires expert knowledge in advance and quite a bit of intelligence gathering beforehand so it's highly unlikely.\n\nSteps you should probably take now (technology security wise - legal is a whole different issue that requires a different approach):\n\n* Check the configuration of your router\n* If something seems off reset it to factory and reconfigure from scratch\n* Reset your phone to factory and reconfigure from scratch\n* Wipe any MicroSD card you have inserted into the phone\n* Check all other devices that are connected to your local network for recent changes\n\nIf you're going to go the legal route you'll want to preserve proof of illegal access and tampering, so backup everything and save screen shots of configuration states (if you know how to do this without impacting any changes), but that also means you can't reset anything, you want them left in tact for the police.  In which case, you'll have to buy new hardware to keep your network usable and a new phone with new SIM and memory card.\n\nThere are other scenarios that could have played out, but really at this point it sounds like you need someone with the right expertise who can help you in person.", "created_utc": 1486777585, "author_flair_css_class": null, "link_id": "t3_5t492c", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1488749766, "updated_utc": 1668776399, "body_sha1": "eec084594a95b24f491ef4727e5fc807e0ec08dc", "utc_datetime_str": "2017-02-11 01:46:25"}, {"id": "ddlh5n6", "author_flair_text": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "edited": false, "link_id": "t3_5t3x9h", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1486773009, "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "gilded": 0, "body": "&gt; The algorithm of Wang and Yu can be used to create files of arbitrary length that have identical MD5 hashes, and that differ only in 128 bytes somewhere in the middle of the file\n\nI have heard hat MD5 is flawed, but I had no idea it was this badly broken.
