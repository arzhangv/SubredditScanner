So I had a copy sitting around because I disabled the extension and copied the files before asking chrome to uninstall it, which was useful for analysis.  I knew I'd need to satisfy my curiosity, having once been heavily involved in infosec in a past life, so that was useful.\n\nA run-of-the-mill phishing operation is the most basic of phishing, not by redirecting to fake versions of the websites you visit, but by simply making these popups that look like they're coming from your \"computer\" (i.e a source of some trust) saying things like \"You are infected, you need antivirus\", or some will go a slightly different approach like \"Congratulation you are visit #9571 klik OK to receive monies\" and when you click ok, you're redirected to a website that might sometimes look like a fake version of an existing website, or it might try to pass itself off as some official body of some kind, especially in the case of the \"visitor lottery\" ones, or it will try passing itself off as a real anti virus software company (sometimes existing, sometimes not) so that you'd download their \"antivirus software\" and run it.  Then they own your computer.  Some of them will just be looking for login details, like for facebook, or your google account, or your email, or anything like that.\n\nOr in the visitor lottery ones, they'll try encourage you to input your sensitive data, such as banking, credit card, tax, social security, whatever numbers, in order to \"receive de monies\" (I always imagine those scammers in the voice of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA3zhzT1wDo)\n\nThe weird URLs are simply a way to make a computable, repeatable, time-based domain change.  So that when one domain gets taken down, just wait till the start of the next month and you'll have a fresh working domain, and don't need any command and control infrastructure or anything, clients will automatically compute the new hash and bob's yer uncle.", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1495930913, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "di4pg5i", "link_id": "t3_6dm5m2", "parent_id": 29393118178, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1496882536, "updated_utc": 1668772190, "body_sha1": "3059a49f9fc6c69d390c4fd77ff3795b3f6b05ce", "utc_datetime_str": "2017-05-28 00:21:53"}, {"author": "IHeartMustard", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "No worries.  Almost definitely not a long con, and I trust they really were phished, because the code in alert10 is very different to the extension code.  For one, the alert10 stuff leads to Russian domains with code that looks similar, with comments written all in Russian.  Also the rest of the Infinity code is minified, as is standard with a build process.  Could they have been trying to get plausible deniability?  I suppose so, but then again, that is a lot of intelligence and effort wasted on that when they could have made it a more convincing phishing attack.  For example, they could have redirected any facebook url to a login page they control.  Or banking page.  Or reddit or whatever.  That one, even though the url would be clearly different, would be a lot harder to catch because it would feel like a redirect from facebook itself.\n\nThat said, I recommend never trusting their extensions again, because they clearly do not hold the level of security we should expect from developers.  I mean, phishing is arguably the lowest security bar.  They admit the attack was because their credentials were phished.\n\n\"Due to cheated by phishing, our Chrome developer account was stolen (now found and change password)\"", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1495929805, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "di4os2n", "link_id": "t3_6dm5m2", "parent_id": 29393484745, "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "retrieved_utc": 1496882212, "updated_utc": 1668772189, "body_sha1": "6c11073f432f183bc80647def021dc648eddddb7", "utc_datetime_str": "2017-05-28 00:03:25"}, {"author": "IHeartMustard", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "No worries, yeah I cant imagine any virus scan would catch this one.
