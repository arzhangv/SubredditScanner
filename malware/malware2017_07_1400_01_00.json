Ignore downvotes when you post something relating to netsec or malware and you're post abides by the rules but people say it's \"simple\" or \"easy\" or \"basic\".\n\nSome people forget that all of us started out with very little knowledge, and a lack of experience. :-)\n\n&gt;So ZeroAccess itself is just the rootkit, but there can be modifications and such to it that give it different capabilities? Is that about right?\n\nRight! And since it's a payload, it's almost like \"mix-n-match\" malware. Any exploit kit/infection kit that you want can most likely be combined with Zero Access payload to match what you want to do. Or any exploit kit can be matched with any payload you want, if Zero Access isn't what you need. Some malware perform all those functions too, which makes it more confusing! But in this case Zero Access does not.\n\n&gt;So how come there are so many white papers and sites saying different things like \"ZeroAccess can sniff traffic\" or \"Alureon has a component that steals your browsing history\"?\n\nSo I can't speak directly on those quotes you just noted, as I do not recall reading those whitepapers. If you want a more targeted response, feel free to link me the sites or papers and I'll do my best to respond!\n\n&gt;If there are so many variants why is it worth doing this if chances are the each infection is probably different than the last?\n\nGood question! There's no real \"one\" answer to this. However, let me lay out why you see this for EVERY variant.\n\nSo the biggest names in Anti-malware products, from symantec, to microsoft, and beyond as well as other security products like \"next gen\" firewalls, comprehensive endpoint protection, from companies like Bit9 and Fire-eye MUST know everything about all this malware if they want people to buy their products and read their blogs. \n\nThey have comprehensive infrastructure and dedicated employees whose job it is to analyze such malware, and create rules and software to fight it, because since there is so much money in malware, malware authors do the same thing to circumvent the anti-malware products! It's a never ending battle! \n\nThis in turn is often then shared around under various Non-Disclosure Agreements, and then publicized for people like you and I, who may either perform malware analysis as a hobby, or only as a small part of our job duties at work.\n\nThis is done to also allow others to \"bootstrap\" off analyses to get information the initial reporter may have missed. \n\nSo as this info gets shared around, all the anti-virus companies build out rules for this malware based on these writeups, and people like myself (information security engineers) who don't often have time to analyze every malware that someone downloads or infects our companies systems, can use to build out our own defenses. \n\nSometimes, malware might be written based off an older variant (or family) but be significantly different. If you read up on Peyta, which you should if you have not, you'll see that the latest variant of Peyta is SO different, that many analysts actually call it \"not peyta\" because of those changes. However when you dig down deep enough, you'll see that 'not peyta' is still based on the old variants, just significantly altered. \n\nAlso, just to mention, a \"family\" is a series of malware and malware variants that share similar characteristics, but are not close enough to simply be variations on a set of malware. Here is a list of top families known in 2017. You can see that Conficker, a REALLY old family, is still noted as infecting many systems, despite it being really old and using older exploits!\n\nhttps://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/10-high-profile-malware-families-2017/\n\nSo to continue on:\n\nWhen reading an analysis, it CAN get confusing as to which variant they're discussing! This is why all analyses worth their salt use hashes to identify the malware. So a hash is basically a string generated by an algorithm that is unique to that specific configuration of code. \n\nSo each variant is identified by it's own hash, that changes when any change is made to the malware code itself. This is how we track malware variants. Virustotal.com, malwr.com (spelled correctly), etc etc will ALWAYS show the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes at the top, and allow you to search by the hash. \n \n\nTake a look at how Symantec identifies Zeus:\n\nhttps://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-011016-3514-99\n\nThe \"also known as\" list is gigantic! Zeus is a widely used malware, which I believe can be bought online, and deploys as a botnet. It's gone through so many iterations that ZeuS itself is a family, and the changes range from the modification of a few actions to significant redesigns. So in this case, you can't talk about analyzing a variant of ZeuS without using hashes, and between variants ZeuS might completely change how it behaves and what it uses when installed or propagated. \n\nAs noted here:\n\n&gt;Infection \nThe Trojan.Zbot files that are used to compromise computers are generated using a toolkit that is available in marketplaces for online criminals. The toolkit allows an attacker a high degree of control over the functionality of the final executable that is distributed to targeted computers. \n\nThe Trojan itself is primarily distributed through spam campaigns and drive-by downloads, though given its versatility, other vectors may also be utilized. The user may receive an email message purporting to be from organizations such as the FDIC, IRS, MySpace, Facebook, or Microsoft. The message body warns the user of a problem with their financial information, online account, or software and suggests they visit a link provided in the email. The computer is compromised if the user visits the link, if it is not protected. \n\nWhat can be bought is basically a framework to ASSEMBLE a variant of Zeus. So just like in school when you had to look at permutations as sandwich combinations, ZeuS can be assembled any which way a buyer chooses. \n\nI apologize for all this information, but most of it (I'm often times needlessly verbose) is important in learning about malware. If you want more links that break this down further, explain things more in depth, and have more pictures, just ask!
