What I was trying to discuss isn't strictly isolated to companies, mainstream researchers, even those not directly associated with A/V also keep the binaries private, and what /u/wmcgrew suggested about this - that it's a matter of trying to be first, to be competitive - is something I think explains this quite well.\n\nYour name, /u/mmd0xff, do you work with malwaremustdie?  The reason I brought up the source code thing was not because I think everybody should have malware source code.  I was trying to suggest that the mistakes researchers make involving some of the information they present is probably worse than just handing out binaries. The mmd website, not just once, but twice from what I read through the blog accidentally stated that troves of malware source code were available.  [You?] didn't offer it up yourself, that would have been a little much, but for the most recent one that I linked to, you gave a website name, and sort of obfuscated it a little.  I googled it, [xa()ep], found it, grabbed source.  But yet you say \"we're keeping it safe, we'll give it to law enforcement but we don't want it getting to anybody else\".\n\nIt could be that I misunderstood what you were trying to accomplish by this, and, given that you do now warn about accessing the site directly, maybe you did know that you were in fact showing it to people who might otherwise not have known about it.", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "parent_id": 27211464780, "created_utc": 1402281093, "downs": 0, "id": "ci2njch", "retrieved_utc": 1434154071, "updated_utc": 1668794389, "body_sha1": "99072fadb55147c7b40dbbae0ebee1ac3cbc5bb1", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-06-09 02:31:33"}, {"author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1402269468, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": null, "removal_reason": null, "ups": 1, "id": "ci2iptn", "body": "[Here](https://public.gdatasoftware.com/Web/Content/INT/Blog/2014/02_2014/documents/GData_Uroburos_RedPaper_EN_v1.pdf) is the original report the same firm did on Uroburos.", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "link_id": "t3_27djif", "author": "UnknownBinary", "downs": 0, "score": 1, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "score_hidden": false, "edited": false, "archived": true, "retrieved_utc": 1434151732, "updated_utc": 1668794384, "body_sha1": "67df631a89112789545e9cb9fa074c65e03fded1", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-06-08 23:17:48"}, {"score_hidden": false, "archived": true, "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "link_id": "t3_27n88o", "author": "mmd0xFF", "downs": 0, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "body": "The previous /r/netsec comments are here: http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/27mj6u/malware_must_die_ddoser_as_service_a_camouflation/\n\nThis is why I moved it to /r/Malware : http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/27mj6u/malware_must_die_ddoser_as_service_a_camouflation/ci2clcw", "id": "ci2fyhm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "removal_reason": null, "created_utc": 1402262625, "gilded": 0, "parent_id": null, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "retrieved_utc": 1434150432, "updated_utc": 1668794383, "body_sha1": "0f624d78e4acc675b10db4ce97c63bd912d539e8", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2014-06-08 21:23:45"}, {"score_hidden": false, "archived": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "edited": false, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_27gpnn", "author": "gigablog", "created_utc": 1402257407, "score": 2, "removal_reason": null, "id": "ci2dqdc", "parent_id": 27213195073, "downs": 0, "ups": 2, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "Malware", "body": "Well the function is Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() which returns the storage depending on the env, so yes it could access emulated storage however when I quickly looking at emulated storage it seems that many developers trying to access emulated storage with getExternalStorageDirectory() get varying success rates.", "retrieved_utc": 1434149316, "updated_utc": 1668794382, "body_sha1": "5a44d3270551f0e22d3820a7ae0c5552ee6dea0f", "utc_datetime_str": "2014-06-08 19:56:47"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 214, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 4, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1402210860000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1402297260000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1402210860000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1402297260000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.0794744, "api_request_start": 1674102769.363453, "api_request_end": 1674102769.6159015, "api_total_time": 0.25244855880737305}}
