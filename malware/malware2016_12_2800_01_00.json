BTW I don't work for them.  I've been told they plan to raise the price 10% every year, because they can. For training you get what you pay for, unless it is free and your time is free.  Consider it an investment in yourself and save up for it.  If it takes you a year to save, then look at it as a process. I paid for 610 myself in 2010 when it was $2500, it was worth the investment for my career.  Props to the SANS 610 author Lenny Z. https://zeltser.com/about/ Finally, be sure to see the SANS workstudy program https://www.sans.org/work-study/ for deep discounts.\n\nI have not taken any of the eLearningSecurity classes but have watched their webcasts and they are technical. Before you spend any of your money, I'd do two things: 1. go over the free material at https://www.cybrary.it/course/malware-analysis/ 2. buy the book Practical Malware Analysis then find a local friend and then together go over the book and Sam's material here https://samsclass.info/126/126_S16.shtml.  Sam's exercises go along with the book and are a good learning tool. The labs go step by step and are practical.  Best of luck.  \n\nP.S. learn Python if you haven\u2019t. In 20 years, all malware analysis will be done with AI and from what I can tell the data scientists are building AI frameworks on Python, but that is for another reddit post. \n", "created_utc": 1482930330, "subreddit": "Malware", "id": "dbpq71e", "controversiality": 0, "author": "triarius_line", "score": 2, "author_flair_text": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1484098846, "updated_utc": 1668780075, "body_sha1": "11b886695904ec14048cb7263a8a3fdb57f3b158", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-12-28 13:05:30"}, {"link_id": "t3_5kpono", "edited": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "created_utc": 1482929984, "body": "Great reply!\nI was wondering... since you took sans in 2010 are you allowed to view updated content to keep prior students up to date?", "stickied": false, "parent_id": 29006497513, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "score": 2, "author": "ragnar_graybeard87", "controversiality": 0, "id": "dbpq27e", "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "retrieved_utc": 1484098774, "updated_utc": 1668780074, "body_sha1": "af926b00f258b4615c62627e521aa749c66d560b", "utc_datetime_str": "2016-12-28 12:59:44"}, {"score": 1, "author": "[deleted]", "controversiality": 0, "id": "dbppwq1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "parent_id": null, "distinguished": null, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "edited": true, "link_id": "t3_5kpono", "body": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "created_utc": 1482929572, "subreddit": "Malware", "retrieved_utc": 1484098702, "updated_utc": 1668780074, "body_sha1": "228f7d207920fb84335fac5b2b06ed7b472ece9e", "edited_on": 1482929970, "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2016-12-28 12:52:52"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 89, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 12, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1482912060000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1482998460000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1482912060000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1482998460000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673945683.810305, "api_request_start": 1674105246.007175, "api_request_end": 1674105246.134698, "api_total_time": 0.12752294540405273}}
