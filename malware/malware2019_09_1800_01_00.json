I'd say as a general set of rules: 1) don't install software (mostly services/servers) you don't need; 2) don't install software from untrusted websites, stick with the package manager (which verifies crypto signatures) or websites of known vendors; 3) don't visit shady websites, and if you must, do so in a virtual machine; 4) turn off the computer when not in use; 5) use an ad-blocker; 6) encrypt your hard drive.\n\n1. Some software opens ports on your computer, and this is how someone could attack your computer remotely. Windows is notorious for this. This can be tested by running a port scan against your computer with [nmap](https://nmap.org/).\n2. Download software from the vendor's website. Don't go to ShadyWebsite.org to download a program made by Apple, Microsoft, etc. Go to their respective websites to download it. This helps to make sure that what you're downloading isn't malware, and isn't out of date (which could have known vulnerabilities). Linux package managers have crypto keys which verify that the file downloaded is legit.\n3. Some people visit shady websites for a variety of purposes. Some for illegal materials, sometimes porn, etc. Don't do it, but use a virtual machine if you must. This way the VM, which is disposable, gets messed up and not your computer. Of course, don't use that VM for anything other than shady-ness.\n4. Turn off your computer when not in use, limits whom can access it remotely or in-person.\n5. I get it that websites rely on adverts for revenue, but a lot of advert networks don't screen their advertisements. Some legit websites, [such as Forbe](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3021113/forbes-malware-ad-blocker-advertisements.html)s, have been found to be providing malware via malicious advertisements. Until advertisers and website operators are careful and are willing to protect their viewers, don't give them money.\n6. Linux, Mac OS, and Windows provide hard drive encryption. Use it. It prevents unauthorized people from using the computer, and makes the data unusable in the event that the computer is stolen. With Linux, the encryption must be set up when installed, but with Mac OS and Windows Pro, it can be activated later.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1568828281, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "f0p6ksl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d60mq4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": null, "permalink": "/r/Malware/comments/d60mq4/average_home_user_need_advice_on_avsec_choices/f0p6ksl/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Malware", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrkp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Malware", "subreddit_type": "public", "total_awards_received": 0, "retrieved_utc": 1577158329, "updated_utc": 1668736942, "body_sha1": "bdbf55bf8d3a19681ab4fa0be6bdbc9df0de97a3", "nest_level": 1, "utc_datetime_str": "2019-09-18 17:38:01"}], "error": null, "metadata": {"es": {"took": 72, "timed_out": false, "_shards": {"total": 824, "successful": 824, "skipped": 820, "failed": 0}, "hits": {"total": {"value": 3, "relation": "eq"}, "max_score": null}}, "es_query": {"size": 10, "query": {"bool": {"must": [{"bool": {"must": [{"range": {"created_utc": {"gte": 1568790060000}}}, {"range": {"created_utc": {"lt": 1568876460000}}}]}}, {"bool": {"should": [{"match": {"subreddit": "malware"}}], "minimum_should_match": 1}}]}}, "aggs": {}, "sort": {"created_utc": "desc"}}, "es_query2": "{\"size\":10,\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"bool\":{\"must\":[{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"gte\":1568790060000}}},{\"range\":{\"created_utc\":{\"lt\":1568876460000}}}]}},{\"bool\":{\"should\":[{\"match\":{\"subreddit\":\"malware\"}}],\"minimum_should_match\":1}}]}},\"aggs\":{},\"sort\":{\"created_utc\":\"desc\"}}", "api_launch_time": 1673017478.254743, "api_request_start": 1674109363.2733748, "api_request_end": 1674109363.3813517, "api_total_time": 0.10797691345214844}}
